/**
 * Gate 1 — the textual round trip, over every unique Oracle text in the Scryfall bulk.
 *
 * ```
 * print(parse(normalize(t))) == normalize(t)      // or: declined, and counted
 * ```
 *
 * Roughly thirty thousand assertions that need no human to read them. A rule that quietly drops
 * the word "other", or collapses "up to three" into "three", cannot survive it.
 *
 * Two refinements the bare formula leaves out, both of which the design implies and neither of
 * which weakens it:
 *
 * - **Normalization is gated first.** Before any grammar runs, `restore(lines) == raw` must hold
 *   for the face. A normalization that could not reproduce its own input would let *any* grammar
 *   look correct, so a failure here is counted separately and is always a bug in Assay.
 * - **Alternate spellings are a verdict, not a failure.** `canonical = false` rules exist so one
 *   meaning has one printed form; a card printed "Ward—{2}" therefore prints back as "Ward {2}".
 *   Nothing was lost — reparsing the printed line yields the identical model — so it is recorded
 *   as [LineVerdict.VARIANT] rather than counted as a round trip *or* as a mismatch. Only a
 *   printed line whose model does **not** survive reparsing is a [LineVerdict.MISMATCH], and that
 *   number must be zero.
