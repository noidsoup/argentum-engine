/**
 * Scryfall Oracle text → canonical ability lines, **and back**.
 *
 * The touchstone compares against normalized text, so normalization is load-bearing: if a pass
 * throws information away, the round trip stops being a proof and becomes a formality — you can
 * always pass a round trip by normalizing hard enough. Every pass here is therefore *invertible by
 * construction*: what it removes or rewrites is recorded on the [NormalizedFace] it produces, and
 * [NormalizedFace.restore] replays the inverses in reverse order to rebuild the original bytes.
 *
 * Passes, in order:
 *
 * | Pass | Forward | Inverse |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | Reminder text | strip ` (…)` spans | re-insert at the recorded offsets (or regenerate — see [Reminders]) |
 * | Self-reference | the face's own name → `~`, longest-match first | put the recorded surface form back |
 * | Attachment noun | "equipped creature" → "enchanted creature" | put the recorded surface word back |
 * | Ability split | one ability per line, bullets kept with their header | join with `\n` |
 * | Ability word | strip a line's `Landfall — ` prefix | put the recorded word back on that line |
 *
 * Two passes named in the design are handled elsewhere on purpose:
 *
 * - **Faces** are split by the corpus reader ([OracleFace]), because the split is Scryfall's own
 *   and carries no information of ours to lose.
 * - **Symbols** (`{T}`, `{2}{U}`, `[+1]`) are lexed by the grammar's leaf rules rather than
 *   rewritten here. That is the stronger form of "never as prose": nothing moves, so there is no
 *   inverse to get wrong.
 *
 * Sentence case is likewise not a pass — see [com.wingedsheep.assay.syntax.SentenceCase].

     * Oracle writes a self-reference two ways and they mean the same object, so both abstract to one
     * token and no rule has to know which was printed. That holds everywhere but inside the quotes a
     * *granted* ability is printed in, where CR 201.4 pulls them apart: an ability referring to an
     * object **by name** refers to the object that printed it, while "this creature" refers to the
     * object that has the ability. On an Equipment those are two different permanents — the
     * Equipment and the creature it is attached to, `EffectTarget.GrantingSource` against
     * `EffectTarget.Self` — and the whole distinction is in the printed word.
     *
     * Collapsing them cost a real reading. "Equipped creature has "{1}, {T}: Tap target creature.
     * Return Trusty Boomerang to its owner's hand."" bounces the Equipment; read through one token
     * it bounces the creature, round-trips byte-perfectly and means the wrong permanent. This
     * object's KDoc had recorded that as a known limitation and asserted "the rules that read `~`
     * must not treat it as authoritative inside a quoted ability. Nothing in the grammar does" — an
     * assertion that stayed true only until a rule read the clause, which the `.` band did.
     *
     * ### Why the split is here and not in the grammar
     *
     * Which anaphor was printed is a fact about the *text*, and this file owns those. A second token
     * costs the grammar nothing: no rule spells [GRANTED_SELF], so a line carrying one declines and
     * is counted, which is the honest verdict until a `GrantingSource` vocabulary is written. The
     * twenty-one Slivers and Auras whose quoted ability spells the noun are untouched — they still
     * carry [SELF] and still read as the gaining permanent.
     *
     * Invertibility is unchanged: both tokens append to one positional list in text order, and
     * `NormalizedFace.restore` replays it against either token.
