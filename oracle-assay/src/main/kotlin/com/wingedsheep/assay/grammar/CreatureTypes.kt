/**
 * Clauses that name a creature type the player picks — "becomes the creature type of your choice",

 * the effect resolves, and the SDK carries it as a pipeline slot rather than as a value. That is the
 * opposite of [Filters]' subtype layer, where the word is printed and the model holds it — which is
 * why these are their own sentences and not that layer with a different noun.
