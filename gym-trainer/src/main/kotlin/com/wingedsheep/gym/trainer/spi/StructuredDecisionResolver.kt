/**
 * Resolves "complex" engine decisions — `ChooseTargetsDecision`,
 * `DistributeDecision`, `OrderObjectsDecision`, `SplitPilesDecision`,
 * `SearchLibraryDecision`, `ReorderLibraryDecision`, `AssignDamageDecision`,
 * `SelectManaSourcesDecision`, multi-select `SelectCardsDecision`, and
 * multi-mode `ChooseModeDecision` — that the gym can't fold into a single
 * numeric action space.
 *
 * This is a strategic policy seam: it chooses one response. It remains the
 * fallback when [StructuredDecisionExpander] reports a decision family as unsupported; that
 * resolver-selected edge is not claimed to be the complete legal response set.
 * Supplying a custom [ActionFeaturizer] cannot expose responses that were
 * already collapsed here; enumeration belongs in [StructuredDecisionExpander].
 *
 * The chosen response is checked against the engine's authoritative decision validator before it
 * becomes a search edge, so a resolver is free to be strategically bad but not illegal: an
 * unsatisfiable answer fails loudly rather than being submitted and silently rejected, which would
 * leave the search a child node identical to its parent.
