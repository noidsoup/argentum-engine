     * (CR 701.30b), and the only clash spelling a card should ever author.
     *
     * Three existing pieces, composed:
     *
     *  1. [ChooseOpponentForSourceEffect] fixes *which* opponent clashes with you. Clash chooses an
     *     opponent rather than targeting one, and the same player must both reveal and decide, so
     *     the choice is written to the source's durable `OPPONENT` slot and read back by
     *     [Player.ChosenOpponent]. A bare `Chooser.Opponent` would re-pick per step and could split
     *     a multiplayer clash across two different opponents. With one opponent the choice is
     *     forced and promptless.
     *  2. [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.effects.ClashEffect] performs the clash: reveal, decide,
     *     move, score, and fire "Whenever you clash" for both participants.
     *  3. A [Gate.DoAction] gate scored by [SuccessCriterion.CollectionNonEmpty] reads the win.
     *     "If you win" is an action-*outcome* rider, which is exactly what that gate models — the
     *     clash writes your revealed card into a collection only on a win, so winning is an
     *     ordinary pipeline result and clash needs no gate kind of its own. The gate's existing
     *     continuation plumbing is what carries the two top-or-bottom pauses.
     *
     * [otherwise] is the "Otherwise, …" half printed on Captivating Glance; every other Lorwyn
     * clash card leaves it null.
     *
     * ```kotlin
     * // Adder-Staff Boggart — "When this creature enters, clash with an opponent.

     * **Learn** (CR 701.48) — the Strixhaven keyword action, printed as a bare "Learn." with
     * reminder text.
     *
     * CR 701.48a spells it out, and the order is load-bearing rather than a "choose one":
     *
     * > "Learn" means "You may discard a card. If you do, draw a card. If you didn't discard a
     * > card, you may reveal a Lesson card you own from outside the game and put it into your
     * > hand."
     *
     * So the discard is offered *first*, and taking it forecloses the Lesson — a player who
     * discards never gets the sideboard option. The composition follows that shape literally:
     *
     * 1. Gather the controller's hand and let them choose **up to one** card to discard. The
     *    `ChooseUpTo(1)` is where the printed "you may" lives: choosing none is declining, and an
     *    empty hand auto-resolves to none without a prompt.
     * 2. If they discarded, draw a card; if they didn't, run a Lesson-restricted
     *    [SideboardPatterns.wish], whose own `ChooseUpTo(1)` carries the second "may" — declining,
     *    or owning no Lesson at all, simply does nothing.
     *
     * The discard is a real discard ([MoveType.Discard]), so madness and "whenever you discard a
     * card" triggers see it.
     *
     * Collection names are `learn_`-prefixed so a Learn nested inside another pipeline can't
     * collide with that pipeline's own `hand` / `discarded` collections.

     *
     * A keyword *action* with fixed reminder text (like explore or amass), not a keyword ability,
     * so it needs no `Keyword` entry. Mechanically it is connive (CR 701.50) with a token payoff
     * instead of a +1/+1 counter, and it reuses that proven pipeline shape exactly: Draw →
     * Gather(hand) → Select(1) → Move(Discard) → ConditionalOnCollection(Nonland). See
     * [HandPatterns.connive].
     *
     * Two details the shape is load-bearing for:
     *
     * - The discard is a real discard ([MoveType.Discard]), not a bare move to the graveyard, so
     *   madness and "whenever you discard a card" triggers see it.
     * - The payoff is gated on the discarded card being a *nonland*, never on "no land was
     *   discarded": with an empty hand nothing is discarded at all, and CR's "if you discarded a
     *   nonland card" is then false. `ChooseExactly(1)` auto-resolves on an empty or single-card
     *   hand, leaving the collection empty so no token is created.
     *
     * The draw comes first and is unconditional, so an empty library still sets up the usual
     * draw-from-empty loss at the next state-based check.
     *
     * Token art is left to the set-scoped resolver (`MtgSet.tokenArt`, keyed off the creating
     * card's printing) rather than baked in here — ten HOB cards share this facade.
