/**
 * Single discoverable entry point for the domain pattern objects — multi-step effect
 * compositions (Scry, Mill, mass removal, …) as opposed to the atomic [Effects] facades.
 *
 * Card definitions reach every recipe through this one root: `Patterns.Library.scry(2)`,
 * `Patterns.Group.destroyAll(...)`, `Patterns.Mechanic.blight(2)`. Each domain is re-exported
 * once here (not method-by-method), so adding a recipe touches only its domain object — there
 * is no second registration site. The `FacadeBoundaryTest` enforces that cards go through
 * `Patterns.*` rather than the underlying `*Patterns` objects directly.
