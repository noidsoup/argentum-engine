/**
 * Translate an [EffectTarget] to a [Player] reference for use in pipeline effects.
 *
 * Deliberately **not** total: an unmapped [EffectTarget] throws rather than falling back to
 * [Player.You]. The fallback this replaced was a silent one, and it shipped a wrong card —
 * Mesmeric Orb passed [EffectTarget.ControllerOfTriggeringEntity] and milled the Orb's own
 * controller on every untap instead of the untapping permanent's. A pipeline keyed to the wrong
 * player looks identical to a correct one in the golden snapshot, so nothing downstream can catch
 * it; failing here, at card-construction time, is the only place it *is* catchable.
 *
 * Every caller passes a compile-time-known target, so this throws during `CardDiscovery`/snapshot
 * construction — never mid-game.
