 * Server-side setup helpers for the Momir Basic Vanguard format ([Format.MomirBasic]).

 * Momir Basic has no deckbuilding: every seat plays the same fixed 60 basic lands and starts with
 * the avatar in the command zone. There is no per-match configuration — the random-creature pool is
 * every creature across all sets. This object translates the catalog into the pre-sorted
 * [Format.MomirBasic.eligibleCreatureNames] the engine treats as opaque, replay-stable data.
 * Keeping the computation here (game-server, which already owns the [MtgSetCatalog] → `CardRegistry`
 * wiring) keeps the engine a pure function of `GameState`.
