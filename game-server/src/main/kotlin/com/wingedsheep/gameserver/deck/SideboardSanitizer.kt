/**
 * Drops sideboard entries the card registry doesn't know, at the server boundary.
 *
 * A submitted *deck* is validated and rejected outright when it names a card this engine hasn't
 * implemented. A sideboard isn't: it lives "outside the game" (CR 400.11a) and reaches
 * `GameInitializer` unchecked, where `cardRegistry.requireCard` throws on the first unknown name —
 * so a single unimplemented sideboard card would fail game *initialization*, taking down a lobby
 * whose decks were all perfectly legal.
 *
 * Rejecting the submission instead would be worse: real decklists are pasted from Arena or
 * Moxfield with full 15-card sideboards, and one card the corpus hasn't reached yet would lock the
 * player out of a game they could otherwise play. So unknown names are dropped and reported to the
 * caller for logging — a wish simply won't find them, which is the truth of it.
 *
 * Non-positive counts are dropped too; they can't produce a card and would otherwise sit in the
 * lobby state as noise.
