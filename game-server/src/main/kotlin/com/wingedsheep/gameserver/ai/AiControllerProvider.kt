/**
 * One lock-consistent view of the live inputs needed by a trusted server-side AI controller.
 *
 * [state] is the *unmasked* authoritative state — both players' hands and libraries — the same view
 * [com.wingedsheep.ai.engine.EngineAiPlayerController] reads, and strictly more than the masked
 * `ClientGameState` an [AiPlayerController] is handed at decision time. Only trusted in-process
 * providers get one.
 *
 * [replayHistory] says whether compact inputs reproducing that state exist at all, and if so whether
 * they are complete or only the prefix retained after replay recording reached its cap. Keeping that
 * distinction in the type prevents an external controller from treating a plausible but incomplete
 * action list as the history of the live position.
