/**
 * The Argentum Assay explorer, mounted inside the app so the Set Completion view can frame it as a
 * tab beside the coverage grid.
 *
 * ## Why the page is embedded rather than reimplemented
 *
 * `just assay-explore` already serves this page from `:oracle-assay` against the **live grammar**,
 * and that liveness is the whole point of the tool: a rule you just edited is one restart away from
 * being re-measured. A React port inside `web-client` would be a second implementation of the same
 * views, drifting from the gates it displays — precisely what the module's "it is a view, never a
 * second source of truth" rule exists to prevent. So this serves the same resource and the same
 * handlers ([ExploreApi]) under a prefix, and the client frames it. Nothing here decides anything;
 * if a `when` on a route name appears in this file, it belongs in [ExploreApi].
 *
 * ## Not gated, and what that costs
 *
 * This is mounted on every server, unlike the custom-card sandbox next door. The tool is a *read*
 * over public card text — it holds no state a request can mutate, touches no game, no account and no
 * corpus — so there is nothing here to protect; the reason to think twice is resources, not exposure.
 *
 * Two of them, and [ExploreApi]'s existing behaviour is what makes them tolerable:
 *
 * - **The corpus.** The explorer needs Scryfall's Oracle bulk (~24 MB) out of `~/.cache/scryfall`,
 *   which a production container has no copy of, so the first sweep there downloads it. That is why
 *   the sweep runs on the **first request** rather than at boot: a server nobody opens the tool on
 *   never fetches anything, and the page renders immediately while `status` reports progress. A
 *   sweep that cannot run at all (no cache, no network) leaves the page up with its live parser and
 *   rule tree working and the failure reported — it does not take the endpoint down.
 * - **The goldens.** The differential decodes `mtg-sets` *test* resources, which are not in the
 *   bootJar. In production that page answers with its "no goldens found" message rather than an
 *   error; the rest of the explorer is unaffected.
 *
 *  - GET  /api/assay/explorer          → the page, with its API base rewritten to this prefix
 *  - GET  /api/assay/explorer/{route}  → the read routes (status, overview, cards, declines, …)
 *  - POST /api/assay/explorer/{route}  → the measuring routes (parse, probe)
