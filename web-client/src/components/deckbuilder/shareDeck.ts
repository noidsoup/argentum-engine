/**
 * Deck share-link codec — encode a deck into a compact, URL-safe string and back.
 *
 * Sharing is entirely client-side: the whole deck travels inside the link, so there's no
 * server storage, no token to expire, and a link works as long as the cards still exist in
 * the catalog. This mirrors how the deckbuilder already keeps filter/view state in the URL —
 * the deck just rides along in a `?d=` param.
 *
 * ## Identifying cards by printing, not name
 * A card's `(setCode, collectorNumber)` is its canonical Magic identity and is far shorter than
 * its name — so the v2 wire shape stores printings, not names, and reconstructs the name on
 * decode by looking the printing up in the catalog. Real card names are long and varied (they
 * don't DEFLATE away), so this roughly halves the link versus carrying names; combined with the
 * structural packing below a typical Commander deck drops ~70% (e.g. ~1250 → ~380 chars).
 *
 * Because the codec itself has no catalog, both directions take a resolver callback:
 * [encodeSharedDeck] is handed `name → PrintingRef` (the card's catalog-default printing) and
 * [decodeSharedDeck] is handed `PrintingRef → name`. The caller (the deckbuilder) builds these
 * from `/api/cards`.
 *
 * ## Wire shape (v2)
 * A control-char-delimited text payload — the data has exactly one structure, so a fixed layout
 * beats JSON's per-field labelling. Records are split by RS (`\x1e`), fields within a record by
 * US (`\x1f`), and groups within the compact section by GS (`\x1d`). Card and deck names never
 * contain ASCII control chars, so nothing needs escaping (the deck name is sanitised on encode
 * to guarantee this).
 *
 * ```
 *  rec 0  meta       :  "2"  US  deckName  US  format
 *  rec 1  commander  :  ""  |  name  |  name US setCode US collector     (name kept verbatim — see below)
 *  rec 2  compact    :  group  GS  group  GS …
 *                       group = setCode  US  token  token …
 *                       token = <collector>[:count]   (":count" only when count > 1)
 *                       Within a group, integer collectors are delta-encoded against the previous
 *                       integer (sorted ascending, first delta from 0); non-integer collectors
 *                       (e.g. "12a", "★7") are written verbatim and don't touch the delta chain.
 *  rec 3+ overflow   :  name US count US setCode US collector   (a pinned *reprint* — non-default printing)
 *                    |  name US count                            (a card the catalog can't resolve)
 * ```
 *
 * The compact section holds the common case: a card sitting at its catalog-default printing, so
 * the name is recoverable from `(set, collector)` and need not be stored. The overflow records
 * carry the name for the two cases `(set, collector)` can't round-trip: an explicit pin to a
 * *different* printing than the default (a reprint the catalog's reverse index doesn't point at),
 * and a card missing from the catalog entirely (e.g. catalog still loading at encode time). The
 * commander likewise keeps its name verbatim — it's a single card and the deck's identity, so we
 * never want it to silently drop if its printing can't be resolved.
 *
 * The text is then UTF-8 encoded, DEFLATE-compressed, and base64url-encoded for the URL — the
 * same transport v1 used. Native deflate-raw beats brotli/zstd on payloads this small (their
 * framing overhead dominates), and a preset dictionary buys too little to justify a JS deflate
 * dependency, so the browser-native `CompressionStream('deflate-raw')` stays. The codec is
 * therefore **async**.
 *
 * [decodeSharedDeck] treats its input as fully untrusted (it came from a URL someone pasted):
 * it never throws, validates every field, drops malformed rows, and returns `null` rather than a
 * half-built deck when the payload isn't usable. It also still reads legacy v1 (JSON, name-keyed)
 * codes so old links keep working.
