/**
 * Two-player battlefield sizing, solved for both players at once.
 *
 * The board grid gives the two battlefields rows 2 and 4; this hook measures
 * the height those rows have *together* — read straight off the two row
 * elements, whose sum is fixed by the viewport, the HUD and the hand
 * reservations however the pair is split — plus both players' row stats, and
 * asks `solvePooledLayout` for one card width and the slot height each side
 * needs. GameBoard turns the heights into the grid's row weights and hands the
 * layout to both `Battlefield`s through `PooledBattlefieldLayoutContext`.
 *
 * Measured from the rows rather than derived (container − HUD − reservations)
 * on purpose: the reservations come from the window-derived responsive sizes,
 * which update synchronously on `resize`, while element measurements arrive a
 * frame later through ResizeObserver — mixing the two solved one frame with
 * the new reservation against the old container height, oversizing the cards.
 * Reading the rows keeps every input in one DOM state.
 *
 * No feedback loop: the rows' *sum* does not depend on the weights this hook
 * produces, and the slot width comes from the fixed command-zone and zone-pile
 * columns, never from the cards.
 *
 * Returns null while disabled (multiplayer, where strip cells size themselves)
 * or before the first measurement, in which case each battlefield falls back
 * to its own per-slot solve. `Battlefield` additionally clamps the pooled width
 * to what its own measured slot fits, so a stale frame can never overflow.
