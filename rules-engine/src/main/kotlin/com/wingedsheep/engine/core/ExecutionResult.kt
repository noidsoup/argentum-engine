/**
 * Result of executing a game action or engine step.
 *
 * The engine operates as a reentrant state machine. Every operation returns one of:
 * - **Success**: error == null && pendingDecision == null
 * - **PausedForDecision**: pendingDecision != null (needs player input)
 * - **Error**: error != null (action was rejected, state unchanged)
 *
 * Nested engine steps also use `ExecutionResult` while composing an action and may have built
 * intermediate immutable states before reporting an error. [ActionProcessor] is the public
 * transaction boundary: a top-level error exposes the exact input state and retains only the error
 * message, with no events, pending decision, or processed-trigger marker from the rejected attempt.
 *
 * Game-over is signaled via `state.gameOver` + a [GameEndedEvent] in `events`.
