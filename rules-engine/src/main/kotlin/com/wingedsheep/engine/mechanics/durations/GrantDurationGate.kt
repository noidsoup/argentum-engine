/**
 * The "for as long as …" gates ([Duration] CR 611.2b) as they apply to a **grant** — an ability
 * handed to a permanent and parked in one of the `granted*Abilities` stores, which has no
 * floating-effect representation for [com.wingedsheep.engine.mechanics.layers.StateProjector] to
 * gate per projection frame.
 *
 * A grant needs the same two halves a continuous effect gets:
 *
 *  - a **per-read gate** — the reader (trigger lookup, legal-action enumeration) must not see a
 *    grant whose condition is false *right now*, even if no state-based action has run since the
 *    condition failed. Removing a mannequin counter mid-resolution has to strip the drawback
 *    before the next spell can target the creature, exactly as `StateProjector` drops a floating
 *    effect the moment its counter leaves;
 *  - a **one-way latch** — [com.wingedsheep.engine.mechanics.sba.permanent.EndedDurationExpiryCheck]
 *    physically removes the grant once its condition has failed, so re-adding the counter (or
 *    re-tapping the permanent) cannot resurrect it.
 *
 * Both halves ask this object the same question, which is the point: a gate that disagreed with
 * its own latch would let a grant flicker back on for one read.
 *
 * Every duration this doesn't know about — `EndOfTurn`, `Permanent`, the turn-keyed windows —
 * answers `true`, so callers can apply [holds] unconditionally.
