/**
 * How many times a player may activate a keyword-prefixed "Activate this ability only once" ability
 * — exhaust (CR 702.177) and power-up (CR 702.193) — given the
 * [ExtraOnceOnlyActivations] permissions currently on their battlefield.
 *
 * Lives here rather than in `CastPermissionUtils` because three independent activation-legality
 * paths need the same answer and must not drift: the legal-action enumerators and
 * `ActivateAbilityHandler` (both through `CastPermissionUtils`), and `ManaSolver`'s inlined
 * restriction check for auto-tapping, which deliberately doesn't depend on the legalactions module.

    /**
     * How many activations beyond the printed one [playerId] currently has for [kind] abilities.
     * `null` means "no limit at all" — at least one permission waives the memory outright rather
     * than raising it.
     *
     * Both printed statics (from the card definition, honoring the permanent's current Class level)
     * and statics granted at runtime are scanned. Each permission's condition is evaluated in the
     * granting permanent's controller's context and re-checked every call, so Elvish Refueler's
     * "During your turn, as long as you haven't activated an exhaust ability this turn" gate stops
     * applying the instant the turn's first exhaust ability is activated. Counted permissions sum,
     * so two Wonder Men grant two extra power-up activations.
     *
     * Two known gaps, both shared with the other player-scoped scans in `CastPermissionUtils` and
     * both unreachable by any printed card today, so they are deliberately left for an engine-wide
     * change rather than fixed here: this reads the **base** `getBattlefield(playerId)` rather than
     * `controlledBattlefield(playerId)`, so a permission source stolen by an opponent (a Layer-2
     * `ChangeController` that never moves the zone entry) keeps applying to its original
     * controller; and entries from `state.grantedStaticAbilities` get no `Duration` gate.
