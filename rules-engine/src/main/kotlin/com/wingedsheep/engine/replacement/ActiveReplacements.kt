/**
 * Enumerates the replacement effects in force for read sites that resolve a replacement
 * *at the point of use* rather than through [ReplacementEffectProcessor]'s
 * `PendingGameEvent` pipeline — today the token-creation helpers.
 *
 * Two sources, and **both matter**:
 *
 *  1. **Printed** — battlefield permanents carrying a [ReplacementEffectSourceComponent]
 *     (Anointed Procession, Worldwalker Helm). Their controller is read from *projected*
 *     state, because control change is a layer-2 effect: a stolen Doubling Season still
 *     names its original controller in its base `ControllerComponent`.
 *  2. **Granted** — the durational riders in [GameState.grantedReplacementEffects] recorded
 *     by `GrantReplacementEffectExecutor` (Kaya, Geist Hunter's "until end of turn, if one
 *     or more tokens would be created under your control, twice that many … instead").
 *
 * A grant deliberately survives its anchor leaving the battlefield — the one-shot ability
 * that created it is done, and the resulting continuous effect stands on its own until its
 * [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.Duration] expires in the cleanup step. So grants are read
 * straight off [GameState], never re-derived from the anchor entity.
 *
 * This is deliberately *not* a match: callers still apply their own event-pattern and
 * filter tests. It only guarantees that a read site which forgets to look at grants can't
 * silently make `Effects.GrantReplacementEffect` a no-op.
