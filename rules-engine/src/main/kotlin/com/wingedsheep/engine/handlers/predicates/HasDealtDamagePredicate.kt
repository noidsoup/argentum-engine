/**
 * Whether the permanent held by [container] satisfies [StatePredicate.HasDealtDamage] — "has dealt
 * damage", in the window the predicate names.
 *
 * The single read behind every dispatch site (target/gather filtering, group-static projection,
 * trigger gating) and behind `Conditions.SourceHasDealtDamage`, which is `SourceMatches` over the
 * same predicate. It answers purely from the per-permanent [HasDealtDamageComponent] marker plus
 * [currentTurn] — no projection, no source context — so every site gives the same answer.
 *
 * The marker's presence is the lifetime window (since the permanent entered the battlefield as its
 * current object, CR 400.7); its recorded turn matched against [currentTurn] is the per-turn one.
 * Because both windows read one marker, no damage path can satisfy one without satisfying the other,
 * and the per-turn window needs no end-of-turn cleanup — the stamp simply stops matching.
 *
 * @param currentTurn `state.turnNumber`. Only consulted for the per-turn window.
