/**
 * Executor for [CreateRandomCreatureTokenWithManaValueEffect] — the Momir Basic avatar payoff.
 *
 * Composes three atomic steps: gather the candidate creatures, select one at random with the
 * game's seeded RNG, and mint a token copy of it.
 *
 *  1. **Gather** — read the set-scoped eligible-creature pool from the active
 *     [Format.MomirBasic.eligibleCreatureNames] and filter to creatures whose mana value equals
 *     the resolved [CreateRandomCreatureTokenWithManaValueEffect.manaValue]. The list is *filtered*
 *     (not re-collected from the registry, whose map order is unspecified) and re-sorted by name so
 *     the candidate order is deterministic regardless of how the pool was supplied — a precondition
 *     for replay-stable RNG.
 *
 *     Creatures with genuinely **no mana cost** ([CardDefinition.hasNoManaCost]) are dropped, and
 *     dropped here rather than only at the pool's source: the pool is opaque data supplied from
 *     outside the engine, so this is the only place the exclusion can be guaranteed. A card with
 *     no mana cost has mana value 0 (CR 202.1b — no mana cost is an *unpayable* cost, CR 118.6),
 *     which silently lands it in the X=0 bucket even though it is not a card anybody could ever
 *     cast: in practice these are the meld results (CR 701.42) such as
 *     Hanweir, the Writhing Township, which exist in the corpus but are never real deck cards.
 *     "{0}" is a *printed*, payable cost and stays eligible (Ornithopter, Memnite).
 *  2. **Select** — `GameRng.pick` over the sorted candidates, threading the advanced RNG back onto
 *     the state. If no creature has that mana value, nothing happens (the activation cost was still
 *     paid — CR: an effect that can't do anything does nothing).
 *  3. **Mint** — [TokenFromDefinition.mint] puts a token copy of the chosen definition onto the
 *     controller's battlefield.
