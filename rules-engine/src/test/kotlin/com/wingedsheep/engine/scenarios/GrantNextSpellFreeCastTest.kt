/**
 * Tests for the one-shot "the next matching spell you cast this turn can be cast without paying its
 * mana cost" rider ([com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.effects.GrantNextSpellFreeCastEffect]), the
 * primitive behind World War Hulk chapter I.
 *
 * Sibling of [MakeNextSpellUncounterableTest]: a pending rider held on the game state, matched
 * against the controller's next cast and then consumed. The properties that distinguish it from the
 * battlefield static [MayCastWithoutPayingManaCost] — it outlives its source, it isn't gated on
 * being the turn's first spell, and it's spent by the cast rather than by the discount — are what
 * this file pins down. The card-level filter behaviour lives in [WorldWarHulkScenarioTest].
