/**

 * attacked, damage removing defense, and the two state-based actions that bin a battle.
 *
 * Uses inline test battles rather than printed cards: a Siege (the only battle type that exists in
 * paper — CR 310.12) and a hypothetical typeless battle, which is the only way to exercise both the
 * CR 310.9a branch where a battle's own controller is the only player who can protect it and the CR 704.5w
 * 0-defense action that, unlike a Siege's CR 704.5v, has no pending-trigger reprieve.
