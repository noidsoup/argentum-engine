/**
 * `spell { selfShuffleIntoLibrary() }` — the card-intrinsic "Shuffle <card name> into its owner's
 * library." clause printed on the Mirrodin Besieged Zenith cycle.
 *
 * The sibling of `selfExile()`: both replace the destination of **CR 608.2n** ("as the final part of
 * an instant or sorcery spell's resolution, the spell is put into its owner's graveyard"), read by
 * `StackResolver` at the same seam. What makes it worth its own test file is that the seam is
 * **duplicated**: `StackResolver` decides the destination once on the full-resolve path and again on
 * the paused-resolve path, and each then places the card at its own site. A card whose effect never
 * pauses exercises only the first pair — and Green Sun's Zenith, the cycle's headline card, pauses
 * for its library search and so takes the *other* one. Wiring one and not the other fails silently:
 * the card simply turns up in the graveyard.
 *
 * The negative cases matter as much as the positive ones. Unlike the cast-this-way rider
 * ([com.wingedsheep.engine.state.components.identity.AfterResolveDestinationComponent], covered by
 * [AfterResolveDestinationScenarioTest]), this clause is part of the spell's *effect*, so a spell
 * that never resolves never performs it:
 *
 * - **Countered** (CR 701.5a) — the spell is put into its owner's graveyard, and no part of its
 *   effect happens. Graveyard, not library.
 * - **Fizzled** (CR 608.2b) — a spell whose every target is illegal doesn't resolve. Same answer.
 *
 * That is the exact opposite of the rider's answer to the same two questions, which is why both
 * files exist.
 *
 * Two things about the seam are worth knowing before adding a card here:
 *
 * - **Flashback and harmonize still win.** They are the only replacements at this seam worded
 *   "exile this card instead of putting it *anywhere else* any time it would leave the stack"
 *   (CR 702.34a, CR 702.180a); every other clause — the cast-this-way rider, rebound, Adventure,
 *   Omen — names the *graveyard*, which is why the printed clause beats those and not these.
 *
 * - **The paused path moves the card early.** `StackResolver` puts the spell in the library and
 *   shuffles while the decision is still pending, so the remainder of that same resolution sees the
 *   card already in the library. Harmless for Green Sun's Zenith — a search's candidate list is
 *   built during effect execution, before the move, so the Zenith can never find itself — but it is
 *   a sharper edge than the same early move is for `selfExile()`, because a library card can be
 *   drawn or searched. A future pausing self-shuffling spell whose later steps draw cards would
 *   need this revisited (Blue Sun's Zenith's own ruling — "you won't be able to draw the same Blue
 *   Sun's Zenith that you cast" — depends on the ordering).
