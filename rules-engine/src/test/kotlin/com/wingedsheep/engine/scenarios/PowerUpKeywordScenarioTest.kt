/**
 * Feature tests for the **Power-up** keyword (CR 702.193) — "Power-up — [Cost]: [Effect]" means
 * "[Cost]: [Effect]. If this permanent entered this turn, this ability's cost is reduced by this
 * permanent's mana cost. Activate this ability only once."
 *
 * The three clauses, and what pins each one down here:
 *  - **"Activate only once"** — the `isPowerUp` marker desugars to [ActivationRestriction.Once], so
 *    a second activation is illegal for that object's lifetime, and per CR 400.7 a permanent that
 *    leaves and re-enters is a new object that may activate again.
 *  - **The cost reduction** — pip-wise per CR 702.193b/118.7, *not* generic-only. The tests below
 *    deliberately use costs where a generic-only reduction of the same mana value would leave a
 *    cost the player's lands cannot pay, so a regression to `reduceGeneric` fails rather than
 *    silently passing.
 *  - **"If this permanent entered this turn"** — the discount is gone on every later turn, and the
 *    enumerator's displayed cost and the handler's paid cost agree in both states.
 *
 * The last context covers the *extra-turn lockout* Kang the Conqueror puts on the mechanic — "Take
 * an extra turn after this one. During that turn, power-up abilities can't be activated." — which
 * is the `powerUpAbilitiesCantBeActivated` rider on `TakeExtraTurnEffect`. Five things pin it down:
 * it does not bind the rest of the turn that created it, it binds *both* players during the extra
 * turn (enumerator and handler alike), it reaches a power-up activated from outside the battlefield
 * (the command zone, whose enumerator is separate), it lifts when that turn ends, and it never
 * applies at all when a `PreventExtraTurns` source means there is no extra turn to bind.
