/**
 * `SetBaseStatsEffect(reevaluateContinuously = true)` — the layer 7b base-P/T *set* whose
 * `DynamicAmount` is recomputed on every projection pass instead of snapshotted at resolution.
 *
 * This is what an effect that hands a creature a quoted static ability needs: Ms. Marvel, Kamala
 * Khan's "Until end of turn, this creature gains 'This creature's base power is equal to the number
 * of cards in your hand.'" Such a self-granted ability is **not** a characteristic-defining ability
 * (CR 604.3a fails on criterion 2, "printed on the card it affects", and criterion 4, "not an
 * ability that an object grants to itself"), so it applies in layer 7b — CR 613.4b, "effects that
 * refer to the base power and/or toughness of a creature apply in this layer" — and not in 7a.
 *
 * The matrix below pins the whole contract of the flag:
 *  - the value moves when the input moves, and the default (snapshot) does not;
 *  - +1/+1 counters and pump effects — both layer 7c, which CR 613.4c defines as "effects **and
 *    counters** that modify power and/or toughness" — apply *on top* of the re-evaluated base rather
 *    than being overwritten by it;
 *  - a `null` half leaves the other printed stat alone, in both the power-only and toughness-only
 *    directions;
 *  - the effect ends with its `Duration`;
 *  - it keeps applying, and keeps re-evaluating, after the permanent that granted it has left
 *    the battlefield (the projector falls back to the effect's captured controller);
 *  - two competing layer 7b sets resolve in timestamp order, in both directions;
 *  - and a `DynamicAmount` the projector could not evaluate is rejected at resolution rather than
 *    silently read as 0 on every pass.
 *
 * The test cards below all say "target creature **you control**" deliberately: under
 * `reevaluateContinuously = true` the projector rebuilds the context from the *source*, so "your
 * hand" inside the quoted clause is the granting player's hand, not the affected creature's
 * controller's. That is right for a self-grant and for a creature you control, and would be wrong
 * for a grant to an opponent's creature — see the contract on `SetBaseStatsEffect`.
