/**
 * Guards the tap/untap event contract: a permanent that *becomes tapped or untapped while on the
 * battlefield* must go through the [com.wingedsheep.engine.core.tap] /
 * [com.wingedsheep.engine.core.untapOrConsumeStun] atoms, which own the transition guard
 * (CR 603.2f — no event on a non-transition) and the [com.wingedsheep.engine.core.TappedEvent] /
 * [com.wingedsheep.engine.core.UntappedEvent] emission.
 *
 * Open-coding `with(TappedComponent)` / `without<TappedComponent>()` is how the engine repeatedly
 * lost tap events — station creatures and the declare-attackers loop both shipped a silent tap that
 * "becomes tapped" triggers never saw, because the mutation and its event were two separate lines
 * and the event got forgotten. Routing through the atoms makes the event structurally impossible to
 * drop; this test makes the *bypass* structurally impossible to add.
 *
 * If this test fails, replace the raw mutation with `tap(state, id)` (emits [TappedEvent]) or
 * `untapOrConsumeStun(state, id)` (emits [UntappedEvent] / consumes a stun counter), and fold the
 * returned event(s) into the result.
 *
 * Exceptions — files that set/clear [com.wingedsheep.engine.state.components.battlefield.TappedComponent]
 * outside the atoms — are listed in [ALLOWED_FILES] with a justification. Every one is a
 * non-transition: permanents entering the battlefield tapped (taplands, tokens, sneak), phasing in
 * tapped, and the leave-the-battlefield untap cleanup, none of which is a "becomes tapped/untapped"
 * event (CR 603.2f / 603.6e), so none emits one.
 *
 * Regeneration used to be the one real tap on this list. It no longer is: CR 701.19a defines
 * "Regenerate [permanent]" as "…remove all damage marked on it and its controller taps it", and
 * `ZoneMovementUtils.applyRegenerationReplacement` now routes that through
 * [com.wingedsheep.engine.core.tap], so it emits a [TappedEvent] and stamps the first-time window
 * like any other tap. The file stays allowlisted only for its *untap* cleanup write.
 *
 * **Two known holes in the scan**, both currently benign: [RAW_TAP_PATTERN] matches
 * `.with(TappedComponent)` / `.without<TappedComponent>()` but not `components.add(TappedComponent)`
 * (used by the token executors), and [sourceRoot] covers only `rules-engine/src/main/kotlin`, so
 * `game-server`'s scenario builder is out of range. Every current hit of both kinds is a legitimate
 * enters-tapped site — but arguments that lean on this guard being exhaustive should say so.
