These public-safe synthetic gameplay traces were executed and verified by the
unchanged parent engine at `fba4b704cb213843a1420809e0cf6aee656045c9`.
They cover nested may decisions with an automatic outer tail, repeat-while,
a mana-payment suspension nested under a Birds of Paradise color choice,
free Naturalize target selection, and Secluded Steppe cycling with Astral Slide.

The saved initial and after-action states here are frozen current-format
representations of those captures. The reader at
`6f222eb05a1d9e61f540217b2b372960ddf051c7` converted only suspension storage,
then serialized with `encodeDefaults = true`. Conversion did not rerun gameplay.
Each manifest retains the original `sourceRevision`, witness, and verification,
and separately records `representationReaderRevision` and encoding configuration.
The original actions and events are unchanged. Original wire-format captures and
the general migration reader belong to the companion compatibility change.

`SuspensionTraceTest` loads these files using only the current-format reader and
replays the recorded choices. It compares every resulting state's gameplay data,
normalizing only the routing counter and owned question IDs: automatic work no
longer spends question IDs, so later responses are rebound to the current question
without changing player or choice payload. Cycling also compares the exact event
list, final hand/library sizes, and drained stack. Current-format roundtrips are
checked throughout. This preserves before-and-after behavioral evidence whether
or not runtime support for old snapshots is deployed.

Re-captured on 2026-09-07 when this branch merged `main`'s object-identity feature
(`objectIdentities`, `nextObjectGeneration`, and `objectReferences` on continuations).
The recorded `state.json` and `actions.json` are unchanged; the expected `after-N.json`
were re-derived by replaying those same actions. `events-N.json` was rewritten only where
the new feature genuinely emits more: the LIBRARY->HAND draw in `compact-cycling`, and the
HAND->STACK cast plus the stack-origin on the graveyard move in `free-cast-target`. The
`nested-may`, `repeat-while` and `suspended-mana-window` event lists still match the
original parent capture byte for byte, which is what shows the suspension change itself
did not alter behaviour.
