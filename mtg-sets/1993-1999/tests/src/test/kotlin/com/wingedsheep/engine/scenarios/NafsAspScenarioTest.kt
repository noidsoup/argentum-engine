/**
 * Scenario tests for Nafs Asp's deferred-bite delayed trigger.
 *
 * Oracle: "Whenever this creature deals damage to a player, that player loses 1 life
 * at the beginning of their next draw step unless they pay {1} before that draw step."
 *
 * Covers the new [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.effects.CreateDelayedTriggerEffect.fireOnPlayer]
 * axis end-to-end: the damaged player is captured at schedule time, the delayed trigger
 * is gated to fire only on *that* player's draw step (not Nafs Asp's controller's), and
 * the pay-or-suffer decision is presented to the damaged player.
