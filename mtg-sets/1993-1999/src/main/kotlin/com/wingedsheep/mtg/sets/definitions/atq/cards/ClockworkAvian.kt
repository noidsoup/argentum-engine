/**
 * Clockwork Avian
 * {5}
 * Artifact Creature — Bird
 * 0/4
 * Flying
 * This creature enters with four +1/+0 counters on it.
 * At end of combat, if this creature attacked or blocked this combat, remove a +1/+0 counter from it.
 * {X}, {T}: Put up to X +1/+0 counters on this creature. This ability can't cause the total number
 *   of +1/+0 counters on this creature to be greater than four. Activate only during your upkeep.
 *
 * Modeling notes:
 * - The +1/+0 counters are real stat counters (CR 613.4c, layer 7c) — base 0/4 with four +1/+0 counters
 *   makes it a 4/4. They are shed one per combat it fought (the "attacked or blocked this combat"
 *   end-of-combat trigger), and refilled during your upkeep.
 * - "Put up to X, but never above four total" is modeled as putting
 *   `min(X, 4 - current +1/+0 counters)` counters (floored at 0): the player chose X by paying the
 *   {X} cost; the cap clause then bounds the effective placement. The {X},{T} ability is restricted
 *   to your upkeep.
