/**
 * Goblin Matron
 * {2}{R}
 * Creature — Goblin
 * 1/1
 * When this creature enters, you may search your library for a Goblin card, reveal that card,
 * put it into your hand, then shuffle.
 *
 * Portal Second Age is the card's earliest real-expansion printing, so the canonical
 * [com.wingedsheep.sdk.model.CardDefinition] lives here — Urza's Saga and Modern Horizons are
 * reprints.
 *
 * A "Goblin card" is a card with the Goblin creature type, not a card that merely mentions or
 * makes Goblins. Declining the "may" skips the shuffle too, which is why the consent gate wraps
 * the whole search rather than sitting inside it.
 *
 * The filter is `Any.withSubtype`, **not** `Permanent.withSubtype`, and the difference is live
 * rather than pedantic: Tarfire is a `Kindred Instant — Goblin` and Boggart Birth Rite a
 * `Kindred Sorcery — Goblin`, so a Goblin card need not be a permanent, and fetching one is a real
 * Lorwyn-era line. Argentum Assay used to read the phrase the narrower way; this card is what
 * caught it, and the grammar now reads card position correctly.
