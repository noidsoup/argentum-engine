/**
 * Snow-Covered Mountain
 * Basic Snow Land — Mountain
 * ({T}: Add {R}.)
 *
 * Written with the plain [card] DSL rather than the `basicLand` helper: that helper hardcodes the
 * "Basic Land — <type>" type line and cannot carry the Snow supertype. The intrinsic mana ability is
 * spelled out here to match what `basicLand` would have generated.
 *
 * `inBooster = false` is load-bearing rather than cosmetic: `CardDiscovery.findBasicLandsIn` splits
 * on `typeLine.isBasicLand`, which a Basic *Snow* Land satisfies, so without the flag
 * `BoosterGenerator.getBasicLands` would offer this as a freely-addable basic during limited deck
 * building — which the card's own ruling forbids.
