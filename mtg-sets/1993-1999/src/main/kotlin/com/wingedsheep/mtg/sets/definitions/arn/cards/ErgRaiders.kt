/**
 * Erg Raiders
 * {1}{B}
 * Creature — Human Warrior
 * 2/3
 *
 * Modern oracle (errata from "...didn't come into play under your control this turn" to the
 * SBA-friendly form): "At the beginning of your end step, if this creature didn't attack
 * this turn, it deals 2 damage to you unless it came under your control this turn."
 *
 * Composes from existing primitives plus the new
 * [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.predicates.StatePredicate.AttackedThisTurn] history
 * predicate (per-creature, derived from the controller's
 * [com.wingedsheep.engine.state.components.combat.PlayerAttackersThisTurnComponent]).
 *
 * Intervening-if = NOT attacked-this-turn AND NOT entered-this-turn. The latter is the
 * standard summoning-sickness proxy for "came under your control this turn" — it covers
 * every case except the rare control-change-without-ETB, which is not in scope here.
