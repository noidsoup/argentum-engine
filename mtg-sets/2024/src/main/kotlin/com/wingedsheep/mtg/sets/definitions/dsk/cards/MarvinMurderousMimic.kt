/**
 * Marvin, Murderous Mimic

 * Legendary Artifact Creature — Toy
 * 2/2
 *
 * Marvin has all activated abilities of creatures you control that don't have the same name as
 * this creature.
 *
 * Modeled with [GainActivatedAbilitiesOfPermanents]: `grantedTo = GroupFilter.source()` (Marvin
 * himself gains the abilities), `sourceFilter = creatures you control not named "Marvin,
 * Murderous Mimic"`, and `includeManaAbilities = true` because the oracle text says *all*
 * activated abilities (no "except mana abilities" clause, unlike Sharkey). The engine recomputes
 * the gained set continuously from projected state, so the abilities track your other creatures
 * entering/leaving and copies/tokens named Marvin are correctly excluded by the name predicate.
