/**
 * Servant of the Stinger
 * {1}{B}
 * Creature — Human Warlock
 * 1/3
 * Deathtouch
 * Whenever this creature deals combat damage to a player, if you've committed a crime this turn,
 * you may sacrifice this creature. If you do, search your library for a card, put it into your
 * hand, then shuffle.
 *
 * The "if you've committed a crime this turn" clause is an intervening-if (CR 603.4): it's
 * checked both when the ability would trigger and again as it resolves. Modeled via
 * [interveningIf]. The "you may sacrifice this creature. If you do, search..." pay-then-payoff
 * is a [GatedEffect] with a [Gate.MayPay] sacrificing this creature.
