/**
 * Dollmaker's Shop // Porcelain Gallery (DSK 4) — split-layout Room (CR 709.5).
 *
 * Dollmaker's Shop {1}{W} — Enchantment — Room
 *   Whenever one or more non-Toy creatures you control attack a player, create a 1/1 white Toy
 *   artifact creature token.
 *
 * Porcelain Gallery {4}{W}{W} — Enchantment — Room
 *   Creatures you control have base power and toughness each equal to the number of creatures you
 *   control.
 *
 * Cast each half separately; the cast face enters unlocked, the other locked. Pay the locked
 * face's printed mana cost as a sorcery-speed special action to unlock it (CR 709.5e). Each face's
 * ability only functions while that door is unlocked — the engine gates a Room face's
 * triggered/static abilities on its door state, so the Dollmaker's Shop attack trigger and the
 * Porcelain Gallery lord both go live only once their door is open (cf. Painter's Studio //
 * Defaced Gallery, Restricted Office // Lecture Hall).
 *
 * Porcelain Gallery is a Layer 7b base-P/T set ([SetBasePowerToughnessDynamicStatic]) over every
 * creature you control, with the same single count — creatures you control — feeding both power and
 * toughness (the count is recomputed continuously, so it grows as you add creatures and includes
 * the affected creatures themselves and any tokens). Cf. Titania's Song for the group base-P/T set.
