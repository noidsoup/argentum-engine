/**
 * Charred Foyer // Warped Space (DSK 129) — split-layout Room (CR 709.5).
 *
 * Charred Foyer {3}{R} — Enchantment — Room
 *   At the beginning of your upkeep, exile the top card of your library. You may play it this turn.
 *
 * Warped Space {4}{R}{R} — Enchantment — Room
 *   Once each turn, you may pay {0} rather than pay the mana cost for a spell you cast from exile.
 *
 * Cast each half separately; the cast face enters unlocked, the other locked. Pay the locked
 * face's printed mana cost as a sorcery-speed special action to unlock it (CR 709.5e).
 *
 * Notes:
 * - Charred Foyer's upkeep ability is the standard "impulse draw" ([Patterns.Exile.impulse]) with
 *   an end-of-turn play window.
 * - Warped Space is the [MayCastWithoutPayingManaCost] free-cast static, gated to spells cast from
 *   exile (`fromExileOnly`) and to once per turn (`oncePerTurn`). "Pay {0}" is an alternative cost
 *   of nothing, i.e. casting without paying the mana cost (CR 118.9 — additional/mandatory costs
 *   still apply, X is 0). It pairs naturally with Charred Foyer's impulse-exiled cards but applies
 *   to any spell cast from exile (foretell, adventure-in-exile, etc.).
