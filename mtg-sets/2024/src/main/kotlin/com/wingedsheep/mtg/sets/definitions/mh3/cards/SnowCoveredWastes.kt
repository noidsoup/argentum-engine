/**
 * Snow-Covered Wastes
 * Basic Snow Land
 * {T}: Add {C}.
 *
 * Written with the plain [card] DSL rather than the `basicLand` helper, for the same reason as
 * `ice/cards/SnowCoveredIsland.kt`: that helper hardcodes a "Basic Land — <type>" type line and
 * cannot carry the Snow supertype. The intrinsic mana ability is spelled out here to match what
 * `basicLand("Wastes")` would have generated.
 *
 * Wastes has no land subtype, so the type line is bare "Basic Snow Land" — it is not a Plains,
 * Island, Swamp, Mountain, or Forest, and nothing that searches for a basic land *type* finds it.
 * Modern Horizons 3 is its first printing; the two other MH3 art treatments (309, 439) are
 * `Printing` rows alongside this canonical definition.
