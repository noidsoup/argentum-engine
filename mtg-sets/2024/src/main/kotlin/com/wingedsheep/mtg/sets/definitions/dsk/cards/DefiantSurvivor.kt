 * Survival — At the beginning of your second main phase, if this creature is tapped, manifest
 * dread. (Look at the top two cards of your library. Put one onto the battlefield face down as a
 * 2/2 creature and the other into your graveyard. Turn it face up any time for its mana cost if
 * it's a creature card.)
 *
 * Survival is an intervening-"if" postcombat-main trigger gated on the source being tapped, like
 * the other DSK Survival creatures. The payoff is [Patterns.Library.manifestDread].
