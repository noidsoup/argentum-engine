/**
 * Territory Forge — {4}{R} Artifact (The Big Score, mythic).
 *
 * "When this artifact enters, if you cast it, exile target artifact or land.
 *  This artifact has all activated abilities of the exiled card."
 *
 * Implementation:
 *  - ETB trigger gated by an intervening-if [Conditions.WasCast] ("if you cast it"): exile
 *    a target artifact or land, linking it to Territory Forge's `LinkedExileComponent`.
 *  - The static ability [HasAllActivatedAbilitiesOfCards] (`donors = LINKED_EXILE`) reads
 *    that linked-exile pile at activation-legality time and surfaces every activated ability of the
 *    exiled card on Territory Forge itself.
 *
 * Rulings:
 *  - It grants only *activated* abilities — not mana abilities only, not triggered/static ones.
 *  - The exiled card's "this card" references become references to Territory Forge, so a `{T}`
 *    cost taps Territory Forge and a self-sacrifice sacrifices Territory Forge.
 *  - If Territory Forge enters by any means other than being cast, the ETB does nothing (no
 *    card is exiled, so it grants no abilities).
