/**
 * Doorkeeper Thrull — Murders at Karlov Manor #13
 * {1}{W} · Creature — Thrull · 1/2 · Rare
 *
 * Flash
 * Flying
 * Artifacts and creatures entering don't cause abilities to trigger.
 *
 * Torpor Orb on a flash flier — the two-mana body is almost incidental to the lock, and the flash is
 * the point: hold it up, and the moment an opponent's Sun Titan or Clue-maker resolves, the Thrull
 * lands first and the trigger never happens.
 *
 * Straight [SuppressEntersTriggers], widened from its `GameObjectFilter.Creature` default to
 * [GameObjectFilter.CreatureOrArtifact]. Everything the rulings care about is already the shared
 * static's documented behaviour, so nothing is card-specific here:
 *
 * - **The gate is the entering object, not the watching trigger's text.** Suppression is decided by
 *   matching the entering permanent against the filter in *projected* state, so an artifact land
 *   entering stops a "whenever a land enters" trigger, and an enchantment that Opalescence has made
 *   a creature is suppressed too. Both are printed rulings, and both fall out of reading projected
 *   state rather than the trigger's wording.
 * - **Replacement effects are untouched.** Enters-tapped, enters-with-counters, and "as this enters"
 *   choices run through the replacement layer, which the static never sees.
 * - **Simultaneous entries are covered.** The engine applies this as a final filtering pass over the
 *   whole batch of pending triggers, so the Thrull entering alongside another creature suppresses
 *   both — the ruling's exact case — rather than racing its own arrival.
 *
 * The Thrull is itself a creature, so its own entry causes no triggers either; that is the printed
 * behaviour, not an oversight.
