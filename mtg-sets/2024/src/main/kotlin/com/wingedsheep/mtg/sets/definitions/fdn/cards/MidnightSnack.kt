/**
 * Midnight Snack
 * {2}{B}
 * Enchantment
 *
 * Raid — At the beginning of your end step, if you attacked this turn, create a Food token.
 * ({2}, {T}, Sacrifice this token: You gain 3 life.)
 * {2}{B}, Sacrifice this enchantment: Target opponent loses X life, where X is the amount of
 * life you gained this turn.
 *
 * "Raid" is an ability word (no rules meaning); the actual gate is the intervening-if condition
 * that you attacked this turn, evaluated both when the trigger would be put on the stack and
 * again on resolution ([Conditions.YouAttackedThisTurn]). The drain reads the LIFE_GAINED turn
 * tracker via [DynamicAmounts.lifeGainedThisTurn] — if you gained no life this turn, X = 0.
