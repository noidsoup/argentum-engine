/**
 * Quilled Greatwurm
 * {4}{G}{G}
 * Creature — Wurm
 * 7/7
 * Trample
 * Whenever a creature you control deals combat damage during your turn, put that many +1/+1
 *   counters on it. (It must survive to get the counters.)
 * You may cast this card from your graveyard by removing six counters from among creatures you
 *   control in addition to paying its other costs.
 *
 * Modelling notes:
 * - The counters trigger is battlefield-wide (`TriggerBinding.ANY` over
 *   `GameObjectFilter.Creature.youControl()`), not self-bound, and covers combat damage dealt to
 *   *anything* — player, planeswalker, battle or blocking creature (`RecipientFilter.Any`).
 * - "during your turn" is a fire-time gate, so it is a `triggerRestriction` rather than a condition on
 *   the effect: a creature that deals combat damage on an opponent's turn never triggers at all.
 * - "put that many" reads the damage off the trigger payload
 *   (`ContextPropertyKey.TRIGGER_DAMAGE_AMOUNT`) and "on it" is the damage source
 *   (`EffectTarget.TriggeringEntity`). The reminder text "(It must survive to get the counters.)" is
 *   just the normal resolution rule — a dead creature isn't there to receive counters.
 * - The graveyard clause is an intrinsic self-permission with a bundled additional cost:
 *   [MayCastSelfFromZones] keeps normal timing and the printed {4}{G}{G} mana cost, and the six
 *   counters may be of any type spread across any creatures you control.
