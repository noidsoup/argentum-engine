/**
 * Rootwise Survivor
 * {3}{G}{G}
 * Creature — Human Survivor
 * 3/4
 *
 * Haste
 * Survival — At the beginning of your second main phase, if this creature is tapped, put
 * three +1/+1 counters on up to one target land you control. That land becomes a 0/0
 * Elemental creature in addition to its other types. It gains haste until your next turn.
 *
 * "Survival" is an ability word (no rules meaning) — modeled as a postcombat-main-phase
 * trigger ([Triggers.YourPostcombatMain]) with an intervening-if ([Conditions.SourceIsTapped],
 * CR 603.4 — checked both when it would trigger and on resolution). The target is "up to one"
 * land you control (`optional = true`), so the ability still resolves with no target chosen.
 * The animation is permanent — the land stays a 0/0 Elemental creature (in addition to its
 * land type) with the three +1/+1 counters; only the granted haste is bounded to
 * [Duration.UntilYourNextTurn].
