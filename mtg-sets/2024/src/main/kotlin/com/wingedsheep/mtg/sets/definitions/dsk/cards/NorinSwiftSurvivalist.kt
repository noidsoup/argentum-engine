/**
 * Norin, Swift Survivalist
 * {R}
 * Legendary Creature — Human Coward
 * 2/1
 * Norin can't block.
 * Whenever a creature you control becomes blocked, you may exile it. You may play that card
 * from exile this turn.
 *
 * "Can't block" is the [CantBlock] combat static on the source. The blocked-creature trigger uses
 * the ANY-binding `becomesBlocked` factory filtered to creatures you control (same shape as
 * Gustcloak Savior). The optional effect is a gather → exile → grant pipeline over
 * [CardSource.TriggeringEntity] ("it" = the just-blocked creature), granting play-from-exile
 * permission only until end of turn ([MayPlayExpiry.EndOfTurn]) — playing it still costs its mana.
