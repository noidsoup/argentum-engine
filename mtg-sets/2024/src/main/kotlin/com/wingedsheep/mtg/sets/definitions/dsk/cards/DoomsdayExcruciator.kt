/**
 * Doomsday Excruciator
 * {B}{B}{B}{B}{B}{B}
 * Creature — Demon
 * 6/6
 * Flying
 * When this creature enters, if it was cast, each player exiles all but the bottom six cards of
 * their library face down.
 * At the beginning of your upkeep, draw a card.
 *
 * Modeled with existing primitives:
 * - Flying via the keyword.
 * - The ETB is a [Triggers.EntersBattlefield] gated by [Conditions.WasCast] (the intervening "if it
 *   was cast" clause — it does nothing for a token copy or a creature put onto the battlefield
 *   without being cast). "Each player exiles all but the bottom six cards of their library face down"
 *   is one [Effects.ForEachPlayer] over [Player.Each]; the iteration rebinds the body's controller to
 *   each player so [CardSource.TopOfLibrary] (defaulting to `Player.You`) reads that player's own
 *   library. We gather the top `librarySize - 6` cards — i.e. everything but the bottom six —
 *   clamped to zero with [DynamicAmount.IfPositive] so a player with six or fewer cards exiles
 *   nothing (matching the Scryfall ruling). Those cards move to exile face down
 *   ([FaceDownMode.HIDDEN], hidden in exile) via [MoveCollectionEffect].
 * - The upkeep payoff is a standard [Triggers.YourUpkeep] drawing a card.
