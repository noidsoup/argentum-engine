/**
 * Assemble the Players — Murders at Karlov Manor #3
 * {1}{W} · Enchantment · Rare
 *
 * You may look at the top card of your library any time.
 * Once each turn, you may cast a creature spell with power 2 or less from the top of your library.
 *
 * The Precognition Field shape with a power ceiling and a per-turn allowance. Visibility and play
 * permission are separate statics on purpose: [LookAtTopOfLibrary] is the *private* peek (only the
 * controller sees the card — this is not Future Sight's public reveal), and
 * [CastSpellTypesFromTopOfLibrary] is the casting grant. `maxCastsPerTurn = 1` belongs to the
 * granting permanent rather than to the player, which is exactly the printed ruling: two
 * Assemble the Players are two independent permissions, and one that leaves and returns in the
 * same turn comes back with a fresh one.
 *
 * The filter is the *spell's* power, so the disguise/morph ruling falls out for free — a face-down
 * spell is a 2/2 and qualifies whatever the card's printed power is.
