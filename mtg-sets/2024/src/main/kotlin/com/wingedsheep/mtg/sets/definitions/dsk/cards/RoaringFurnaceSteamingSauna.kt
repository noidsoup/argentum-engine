/**
 * Roaring Furnace // Steaming Sauna (DSK 230) — split-layout Room (CR 709.5).
 *
 * Roaring Furnace {1}{R} — Enchantment — Room
 *   When you unlock this door, this Room deals damage equal to the number of cards in your hand
 *   to target creature an opponent controls.
 *
 * Steaming Sauna {3}{U}{U} — Enchantment — Room
 *   You have no maximum hand size.
 *   At the beginning of your end step, draw a card.
 *
 * Cast each half separately; the cast face enters unlocked, the other locked. Pay the locked
 * face's printed mana cost as a sorcery-speed special action to unlock it (CR 709.5e). The
 * Roaring Furnace door-unlock trigger ([Triggers.OnDoorUnlocked]) targets a creature an opponent
 * controls and deals damage equal to [DynamicAmounts.cardsInYourHand]; the Room itself is the
 * damage source (the default when no explicit `damageSource` is given to [Effects.DealDamage]).
 * Steaming Sauna pairs the [NoMaximumHandSize] static with an end-step draw.
