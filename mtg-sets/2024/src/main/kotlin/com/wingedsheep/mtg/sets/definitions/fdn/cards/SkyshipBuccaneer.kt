 * Flying
 * Raid — When this creature enters, if you attacked this turn, draw a card.
 *
 * Raid is modeled as an enters-the-battlefield trigger gated by the intervening-if
 * condition [Conditions.YouAttackedThisTurn] (mirrors Gorehorn Raider / Mardu
 * Skullhunter). The condition is re-checked on resolution, so the trigger does
 * nothing if the "you attacked this turn" state no longer holds.
