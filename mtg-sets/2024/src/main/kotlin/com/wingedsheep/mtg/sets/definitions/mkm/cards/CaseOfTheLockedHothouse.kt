/**
 * Case of the Locked Hothouse — Murders at Karlov Manor #155
 * {3}{G} · Enchantment — Case · Rare
 *
 * You may play an additional land on each of your turns.
 * To solve — You control seven or more lands.
 * Solved — You may look at the top card of your library any time, and you may play lands and cast
 * creature and enchantment spells from the top of your library.
 *
 * The unsolved half is what solves it: an extra land drop each turn is how a four-mana enchantment
 * reaches seven lands, and per the printed ruling the extra drops stack — two Hothouses give three
 * lands a turn.
 *
 * The Solved line is two statics because the visibility and the play permission are separate facts
 * (the same split Assemble the Players uses): [LookAtTopOfLibrary] is the *private* peek — this is
 * not Future Sight's public reveal — and [PlayLandsAndCastFilteredFromTopOfLibrary] is the
 * permission, whose `spellFilter` is the creature-or-enchantment restriction while lands are always
 * included. Both are gated on solved, so the top card stays hidden until the Case is solved rather
 * than being visible but unplayable.
