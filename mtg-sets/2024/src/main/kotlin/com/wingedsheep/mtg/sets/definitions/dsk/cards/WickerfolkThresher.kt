/**
 * Wickerfolk Thresher
 * {3}{G}
 * Artifact Creature — Scarecrow
 * 5/4
 *
 * Delirium — Whenever this creature attacks, if there are four or more card types among cards in
 * your graveyard, look at the top card of your library. If it's a land card, you may put it onto
 * the battlefield. If you don't put the card onto the battlefield, put it into your hand.
 *
 * Delirium is an ability word (no rules meaning of its own); the attack trigger carries an
 * intervening-"if" gate of [Conditions.Delirium] (four+ distinct card types in your graveyard).
 * The payoff is the look-top / play-land-else-hand pipeline (Fecund Greenshell shape), except the
 * land enters untapped ([ZonePlacement.Default]). Card types counted are artifact, battle,
 * creature, enchantment, instant, kindred, land, planeswalker, sorcery — supertypes and subtypes
 * don't count.
