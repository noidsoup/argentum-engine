/**
 * Fear of Burning Alive
 * {4}{R}{R}
 * Enchantment Creature — Nightmare
 * 4/4
 * When this creature enters, it deals 4 damage to each opponent.
 * Delirium — Whenever a source you control deals noncombat damage to an opponent, if there are four
 * or more card types among cards in your graveyard, this creature deals that amount of damage to
 * target creature that player controls.
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 * - The ETB is an [EffectTarget.PlayerRef] over [Player.EachOpponent] (the source attribution is
 *   the enchantment creature itself, matching "it deals").
 * - The Delirium ability is an observer trigger: `dealsDamage(NonCombat, Opponent, sourceFilter =
 *   "you control", binding = ANY)` so any source you control (including this creature's own ETB
 *   damage to an opponent) re-fires it. The intervening-if (CR 603.4) is [Conditions.Delirium] —
 *   checked both when the trigger would fire and on resolution. The redealt damage amount is
 *   [ContextPropertyKey.TRIGGER_DAMAGE_AMOUNT] ("that amount"), the damaged player is the
 *   triggering player ([Player.TriggeringPlayer]), and the damage source is this creature
 *   ([EffectTarget.Self], "this creature deals").
