/**
 * Marina Vendrell's Grimoire (DSK 64)
 * {5}{U}
 * Legendary Artifact — Book
 *
 * When Marina Vendrell's Grimoire enters, if you cast it, draw five cards.
 * You have no maximum hand size and don't lose the game for having 0 or less life.
 * Whenever you gain life, draw that many cards.
 * Whenever you lose life, discard that many cards. Then if you have no cards in hand, you lose the game.
 *
 * The "don't lose for 0 or less life" clause is the narrow [GrantCantLoseGameFromLife] static, NOT
 * the broad Platinum-Angel [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.GrantCantLoseGame]: the controller can
 * still lose to poison, an empty library, or — crucially — this card's own "if you have no cards in
 * hand, you lose the game" clause (a direct [Effects.LoseGame], not the 704.5a state-based action).
