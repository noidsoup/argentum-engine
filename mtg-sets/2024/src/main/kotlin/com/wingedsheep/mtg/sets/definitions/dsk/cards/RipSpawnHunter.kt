/**
 * Rip, Spawn Hunter — Duskmourn: House of Horror #228
 * {2}{G}{W} · Legendary Creature — Human Survivor · 4/4
 *
 * Survival — At the beginning of your second main phase, if Rip is tapped, reveal the top X
 * cards of your library, where X is its power. Put any number of creature and/or Vehicle cards
 * with different powers from among them into your hand. Put the rest on the bottom of your
 * library in a random order.
 *
 * "Survival" is the DSK ability word — mechanically an intervening-"if" postcombat-main trigger
 * gated on the source being tapped (`Triggers.YourPostcombatMain` + `Conditions.SourceIsTapped`),
 * exactly like the other DSK Survival creatures.
 *
 * The payoff is a pure Gather → Select → Move pipeline over existing atoms:
 *  - reveal the top X cards, where X = Rip's power (`CardSource.TopOfLibrary(sourcePower())`);
 *  - the controller keeps any number of creature/Vehicle cards (`GameObjectFilter.CreatureOrVehicle`)
 *    with *different powers* — modeled by the `SelectionRestriction.OnePerPower` restriction on a
 *    `chooseAnyNumberSplit`, which caps the selection at one card per distinct printed power and
 *    rejects any duplicate-power picks server-side;
 *  - the kept cards go to hand; the remainder (unpicked cards plus every non-creature/non-Vehicle
 *    card revealed) goes to the bottom of the library in a random order (`CardOrder.Random`).
 *
 * No new pipeline step is needed: `CardOrder.Random` to the library bottom and a dynamic
 * `TopOfLibrary` count already exist; only `OnePerPower` is new SDK vocabulary.
