/**
 * Cynical Loner
 * {1}{B}
 * Creature — Human Survivor
 * 3/1
 *
 * This creature can't be blocked by Glimmers.
 * Survival — At the beginning of your second main phase, if this creature is tapped, you may
 * search your library for a card, put it into your graveyard, then shuffle.
 *
 * "Survival" is an ability word (no rules meaning) — modeled as a postcombat-main-phase trigger
 * ([Triggers.YourPostcombatMain]) with an intervening-if ([Conditions.SourceIsTapped], CR 603.4 —
 * checked both when it would trigger and on resolution). The search is "for a card" (any card,
 * [GameObjectFilter.Any]) to the graveyard, and is optional ("you may"), so it's wrapped in a
 * [MayEffect]; when you don't search, no shuffle happens. The unblockable-by clause is the unified
 * [CantBeBlockedBy] static over the Glimmer subtype.
