/**
 * Enduring Vitality
 * {1}{G}{G}
 * Enchantment Creature — Elk Glimmer
 * 3/3
 * Vigilance
 * Creatures you control have "{T}: Add one mana of any color."
 * When Enduring Vitality dies, if it was a creature, return it to the battlefield under its
 *   owner's control. It's an enchantment. (It's not a creature.)
 *
 * The mana ability is granted to every creature you control via [GrantActivatedAbility] (the
 * Citanul Hierophants / Cryptolith Rite lord shape); each grantee taps for one mana of any
 * color. A granted mana ability must say so explicitly — the raw [ActivatedAbility] constructor
 * has no builder to derive `isManaAbility` / [TimingRule.ManaAbility] from the effect, and without
 * them the grant is an ordinary stack-using ability (`CardLintTest` now enforces this corpus-wide).
 * The death clause is the Duskmourn "Enduring" mechanic — see [enduring].
