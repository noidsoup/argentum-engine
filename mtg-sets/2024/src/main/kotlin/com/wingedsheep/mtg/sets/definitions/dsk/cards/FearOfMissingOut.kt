/**
 * Fear of Missing Out
 * {1}{R}
 * Enchantment Creature — Nightmare
 * 2/3
 * When this creature enters, discard a card, then draw a card.
 * Delirium — Whenever this creature attacks for the first time each turn, if there are four or more
 * card types among cards in your graveyard, untap target creature. After this phase, there is an
 * additional combat phase.
 *
 * The Delirium attack ability is one triggered ability gated by an intervening "if" (CR 603.4 —
 * [Conditions.Delirium]). Per its rulings the untap and the extra combat phase resolve together:
 * if the target creature is illegal as the ability resolves, neither happens. The phase added is a
 * combat phase only ([Effects.AddCombatPhase]) — no additional main phase (so end-of-combat goes
 * straight into the next begin-combat).
