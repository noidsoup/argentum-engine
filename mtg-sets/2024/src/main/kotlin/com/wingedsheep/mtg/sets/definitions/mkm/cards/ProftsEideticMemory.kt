/**
 * Proft's Eidetic Memory — Murders at Karlov Manor #67
 * {1}{U} · Legendary Enchantment · Rare
 *
 * When Proft's Eidetic Memory enters, draw a card.
 * You have no maximum hand size.
 * At the beginning of combat on your turn, if you've drawn more than one card this turn, put X
 * +1/+1 counters on target creature you control, where X is the number of cards you've drawn this
 * turn minus one.
 *
 * A two-mana enchantment that turns any second draw into a combat trick you never have to hold up
 * mana for. It replaces itself, so the turn it lands it has already done half the work of switching
 * itself on for *next* turn.
 *
 * Three abilities, three plain rails. The interesting one is the third, and it hinges on the
 * distinction between the gate and the amount:
 *
 * - **The gate** is `interveningIf` ([Conditions.YouDrewCardsThisTurn]`(2)` — "more than one" is
 *   "two or more"), not a `triggerRestriction`. That matters in both directions per CR 603.4: the
 *   ability doesn't even go on the stack if the count isn't there at the start of combat (the first
 *   printed ruling), and it is re-checked on resolution, so a Stifle-adjacent effect that somehow
 *   un-drew a card would still fizzle it.
 * - **The amount** is read separately, once, as the ability resolves (the third ruling), so a draw
 *   made in response to the trigger *does* grow X even though it came too late to matter for the
 *   gate. `DynamicAmount.Subtract(TurnTracking(You, CARDS_DRAWN), Fixed(1))` is exactly that:
 *   the same per-player `CardsDrawnThisTurnComponent` the gate reads, evaluated at resolution.
 *
 * The tracker is a turn-scoped count, not a "since this entered" one, so the second ruling falls
 * out for free — draws made before the enchantment hit the battlefield are already in the tally.
 *
 * [Triggers.BeginCombat] is already scoped to `Step.BEGIN_COMBAT, Player.You`, so "on your turn"
 * needs no extra condition.
