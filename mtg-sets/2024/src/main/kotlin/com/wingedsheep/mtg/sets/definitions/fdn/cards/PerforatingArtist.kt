/**
 * Perforating Artist
 * {1}{B}{R}
 * Creature — Devil
 * 3/2
 *
 * Deathtouch
 * Raid — At the beginning of your end step, if you attacked this turn, each opponent
 * loses 3 life unless that player sacrifices a nonland permanent of their choice or
 * discards a card.
 *
 * Raid (ability word, CR 207.2c — flavor only) is the intervening-if
 * [Conditions.YouAttackedThisTurn] on the end-step trigger (Rule 603.4). The payoff is
 * per-opponent: [Effects.ForEachPlayer] over [Player.EachOpponent] rebinds the body's
 * controller to each opponent, so [EffectTarget.Controller] inside resolves to *that*
 * opponent. Each opponent independently faces a [PayOrSufferEffect] — pay by choosing to
 * sacrifice a nonland permanent or discard a card ([PayCost.Choice]), else lose 3 life.
 * This mirrors Starseer Mentor's punisher, widened from "target opponent" to "each opponent".
