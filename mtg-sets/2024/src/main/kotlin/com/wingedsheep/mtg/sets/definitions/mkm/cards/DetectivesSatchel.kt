/**
 * Detective's Satchel — Murders at Karlov Manor #196
 * {2}{U}{R} · Artifact · Uncommon
 *
 * When this artifact enters, investigate twice.
 * {T}: Create a 1/1 colorless Thopter artifact creature token with flying. Activate only if you've
 * sacrificed an artifact this turn.
 *
 * The Satchel is its own enabler: the two Clues it makes on entry are artifacts, and sacrificing
 * one to draw sets the gate for the Thopter. That gate is
 * [Conditions.SacrificedArtifactThisTurn] — MKM's `ARTIFACT_SACRIFICED` turn tracker, the same one
 * behind Suspicious Detonation and Furtive Courier — wrapped in
 * [ActivationRestriction.OnlyIfCondition] so the tap ability simply isn't offered until it holds.
 *
 * Turn history, not a board scan: the sacrificed artifact having since left the graveyard doesn't
 * clear it, an opponent sacrificing their own artifact never sets it, and it resets at cleanup —
 * so the Satchel makes at most one Thopter per turn in practice only because it taps for it, not
 * because the tracker is spent.
