/**
 * Grothama, All-Devouring {3}{G}{G}
 * Legendary Creature — Wurm
 * 10/8
 *
 * Other creatures have "Whenever this creature attacks, you may have it fight
 * Grothama, All-Devouring."
 * When Grothama leaves the battlefield, each player draws cards equal to the
 * amount of damage dealt to Grothama this turn by sources they controlled.
 *
 * The "have it fight Grothama" granted ability is modeled with a `TargetCreature`
 * requirement filtered by name — the oracle text names Grothama literally, so the
 * granted ability targets a creature named "Grothama, All-Devouring". The optional
 * `may` clause is honored by the engine's standard target-skip path: when the
 * controller of the granted trigger declines to choose, the trigger resolves with
 * no effect.
 *
 * The LTB draw effect reads a new per-source-controller damage tracker on Grothama
 * (captured as last-known info on the leave-battlefield event). See
 * `DamageDealtByPlayersThisTurnComponent` and
 * `EachPlayerDrawsForDamageDealtToSourceEffect` in the engine.
