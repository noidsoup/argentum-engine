/**
 * Ezrim, Agency Chief — Murders at Karlov Manor #202
 * {1}{W}{W}{U}{U} · Legendary Creature — Archon Detective · 5/5 · Rare
 *
 * Flying
 * When Ezrim enters, investigate twice.
 * {1}, Sacrifice an artifact: Ezrim gains your choice of vigilance, lifelink, or hexproof until
 * end of turn.
 *
 * The two halves are deliberately self-feeding: the enters trigger banks two Clues, and Clues are
 * artifacts, so the activated ability's fodder arrives with the body. Nothing links them, though —
 * *any* artifact pays, and the Clues are equally free to be cracked for cards instead.
 *
 * "Gains your choice of vigilance, lifelink, or hexproof" is [ModalEffect.chooseOne] over three
 * no-target [Mode]s, the shape Butcher of the Horde established for the identical wording. Each
 * mode is a plain [Effects.GrantKeyword] on [EffectTarget.Self] whose default duration is already
 * end of turn, so the "until end of turn" clause needs nothing spelled out.
 *
 * Three points of rules pedantry the modelling has to respect:
 *
 * - **The choice is made on resolution**, not on activation — `ModalEffectExecutor` resolves an
 *   activated ability's modes when the ability resolves, which is what "your choice of" (as opposed
 *   to a printed "Choose one —") means. An opponent responding to the activation therefore can't
 *   see which keyword is coming.
 * - **Hexproof chosen in response to removal still saves it**, for the same reason: the grant lands
 *   before the removal spell resolves, and hexproof is checked on resolution.
 * - **Ezrim isn't an artifact**, so the sacrifice is a plain [Costs.Sacrifice] over
 *   [GameObjectFilter.Artifact] rather than the `SacrificeAnother` variant — there is no self to
 *   exclude, and no printed "another" to honour.
