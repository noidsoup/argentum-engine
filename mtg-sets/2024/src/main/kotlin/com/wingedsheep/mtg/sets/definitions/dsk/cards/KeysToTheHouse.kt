/**
 * Keys to the House — Duskmourn: House of Horror #251
 * {1}
 * Artifact
 *
 * {1}, {T}, Sacrifice this artifact: Search your library for a basic land card, reveal it, put it
 *   into your hand, then shuffle.
 * {3}, {T}, Sacrifice this artifact: Lock or unlock a door of target Room you control. Activate only
 *   as a sorcery.
 *
 * The second ability uses the resolution-time "lock or unlock a door" choice
 * ([Effects.LockOrUnlockDoor], a `ModalEffect.chooseOne` of [Effects.LockDoor] / [Effects.UnlockDoor]):
 * the controller chooses lock or unlock as it resolves, then locks/unlocks one of the targeted
 * Room's doors (CR 709.5f/g) — prompting which door if the Room has more than one eligible door.
 * "Target Room you control" carries no locked/unlocked restriction: any Room you control always has
 * at least one door of one kind, so either choice can do something.
