/**
 * Beastbond Outcaster
 * {2}{G}
 * Creature — Human Druid
 * 3/3
 *
 * When this creature enters, if you control a creature with power 4 or greater, draw a card.
 * Plot {1}{G} (You may pay {1}{G} and exile this card from your hand. Cast it as a sorcery on a
 * later turn without paying its mana cost. Plot only as a sorcery.)
 *
 * Intervening-if ETB (CR 603.4, ruling 2024-04-12): the draw trigger checks "you control a
 * creature with power 4 or greater" both when it would fire and as it resolves; if it's false at
 * either point, no card is drawn. Power is read through projected state, so counters and lords
 * count. Plot is the named keyword ([KeywordAbility.plot]).
