/**
 * Archdruid's Charm — Murders at Karlov Manor #151
 * {G}{G}{G} · Instant · Rare
 *
 * Choose one —
 * • Search your library for a creature or land card and reveal it. Put it onto the battlefield
 *   tapped if it's a land card. Otherwise, put it into your hand. Then shuffle.
 * • Put a +1/+1 counter on target creature you control. It deals damage equal to its power to
 *   target creature you don't control.
 * • Exile target artifact or enchantment.
 *
 * Three modes, three existing rails — nothing here is new vocabulary.
 *
 * **Mode 1** is the only one that needed thought. The search is a single search with a *branching
 * destination*, so it can't go through `Patterns.Library.searchLibrary` (one `SearchDestination`
 * for the whole call). Instead it is an inline [Effects.Pipeline]: gather creature-or-land from the
 * library, choose up to one, reveal, then `filterSplit` on [GameObjectFilter.Land] and move each
 * half to its own zone. The split is the load-bearing detail — "if it's a **land** card" is not
 * "if it isn't a creature card", so a land creature (Dryad Arbor, Ancient Tomb-style animations are
 * irrelevant here since this reads the *card*) goes to the battlefield, not to hand. Filtering on
 * `Creature` for the second half would double-move it.
 *
 * Both halves are `ChooseUpTo(1)`, so declining the search — or finding nothing — leaves both slots
 * empty and every downstream step is a no-op; the shuffle and the CR 701.23 "a player searched
 * their library" event still fire, because searching happened whether or not a card was found
 * (CR 701.23b). The reveal is `revealToSelf = false`: the searcher just picked the card out of
 * their own library, so only the opponents need to be shown it.
 *
 * **Mode 2** is [BiteDownOnCrime]'s shape exactly: two targets in one mode, and the damage reads
 * `EntityProperty(Target(0), Power)` with `damageSource = yours`, so the +1/+1 counter placed by
 * the first half is already on the creature when the power is read. Per the printed rulings, if the
 * opposing creature has become an illegal target by resolution the counter is still placed; if
 * *your* creature is gone, neither half happens. Both fall out of ordinary per-target legality
 * checking — the counter effect and the damage effect each fizzle on their own target.
 *
 * **Mode 3** is a plain [Effects.Exile] over [Targets.ArtifactOrEnchantment].
