/**
 * Inventive Wingsmith
 * {2}{W}
 * Creature — Dwarf Artificer
 * 2/4
 *
 * At the beginning of your end step, if you haven't cast a spell from your hand this turn and
 * this creature doesn't have a flying counter on it, put a flying counter on it.
 *
 * Intervening-if (CR 603.4, Scryfall ruling 2024-04-12): the end-step ability checks both
 * clauses — "haven't cast a spell from your hand this turn" and "no flying counter" — when it
 * would trigger and again as it resolves. If either is false at either check, the ability does
 * nothing. The flying counter is the "flying" keyword counter, which grants flying via the
 * keyword-counter projection (StateProjector.KEYWORD_COUNTER_MAP).
