 * Trample
 * When this creature enters, if you control another outlaw, create a Treasure token. (Assassins,
 * Mercenaries, Pirates, Rogues, and Warlocks are outlaws.)
 *
 * Intervening-if ETB (CR 603.4): the Treasure trigger fires only if you control an outlaw other
 * than Mine Raider. Mine Raider is itself a Rogue — and therefore an outlaw — and is on the
 * battlefield as the trigger checks, so "you control another outlaw" is exactly "you control two
 * or more outlaws" ([Conditions.YouControlAtLeast] over the [Subtype.OUTLAW_TYPES] creature
 * filter). The condition is re-checked at resolution, so losing your other outlaws first fizzles it.
