/**
 * Omnivorous Flytrap
 * {2}{G}
 * Creature — Plant
 * 2/4
 *
 * Delirium — Whenever this creature enters or attacks, if there are four or more card types among
 * cards in your graveyard, distribute two +1/+1 counters among one or two target creatures. Then if
 * there are six or more card types among cards in your graveyard, double the number of +1/+1
 * counters on those creatures.
 *
 * Delirium is an ability word (no rules meaning); both the enters trigger and the attacks trigger
 * carry an intervening-"if" gate of [Conditions.Delirium] (four+ distinct card types in your
 * graveyard) — modeled as two separate triggered abilities (Sentinel of the Nameless City shape).
 *
 * The payoff distributes two +1/+1 counters across one or two *target* creatures
 * (`TargetCreature(count = 2, minCount = 1)` + [Effects.DistributeCountersAmongTargets]). The
 * second clause is a separate check at resolution: gated on six+ card types ([Conditions.Delirium]
 * with count = 6), it doubles the +1/+1 counters on **those same creatures** — iterating the chosen
 * targets via [IterationSpace.Targets] so [Effects.DoubleCounters] applies to each (one or two).
 * Each target received at least one counter from the distribution, so doubling is always meaningful;
 * a target that became illegal before resolution is simply skipped by the iteration.
