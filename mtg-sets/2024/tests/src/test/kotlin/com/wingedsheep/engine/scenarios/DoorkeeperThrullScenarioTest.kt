/**
 * Doorkeeper Thrull — "Artifacts and creatures entering don't cause abilities to trigger."
 *
 * The card is a plain `SuppressEntersTriggers` widened to `CreatureOrArtifact`, so what is worth
 * testing is that the *widening* actually reaches both halves. The suppressed-creature case would
 * pass on the static's `GameObjectFilter.Creature` default too; the noncreature-artifact case is the
 * one that fails if the filter is wrong, which is why both are here — together with a control run
 * proving the triggers do fire when the Thrull isn't on the battlefield.
