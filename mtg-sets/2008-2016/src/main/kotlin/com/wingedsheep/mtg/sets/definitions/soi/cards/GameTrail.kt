/**
 * Game Trail
 * Land
 *
 * As this land enters, you may reveal a Mountain or Forest card from your hand.
 * If you don't, this land enters tapped.
 * {T}: Add {R} or {G}.
 *
 * Composed from two atoms:
 *  - [OnEnterRunEffect] — generic "as ~ enters, run [effect]" replacement wrapper.
 *  - [Effects.MayRevealCardFromHand] — atomic optional reveal with an `otherwise`
 *    rider that fires when the player declines or has no eligible card. Here the
 *    rider taps the land, expressing "if you don't, this land enters tapped."
 *
 * The whole SOI shadowland cycle (Choked Estuary, Foreboding Ruins, Fortified
 * Village, Game Trail, Port Town) reuses this exact shape — only the filter
 * subtypes and produced mana differ.
