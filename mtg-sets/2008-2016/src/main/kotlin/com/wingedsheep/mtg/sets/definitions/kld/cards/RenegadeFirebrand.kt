/**
 * Renegade Firebrand
 * {2}{R}
 * Creature — Human Warrior
 * 3/2
 * As long as you control a Chandra planeswalker, this creature gets +1/+0 and has first strike.
 * (It deals combat damage before creatures without first strike.)
 *
 * One printed sentence, two [ConditionalStaticAbility] rows: the stat bonus and the keyword grant
 * are separate static abilities that happen to share a condition, because the layer system applies
 * them in different layers. The condition is [Exists] over a battlefield planeswalker with the
 * Chandra subtype — [Player.You] carries the "you control" half, so the filter itself has no
 * controller predicate.
