/**
 * Kalastria Highborn
 * {B}{B}
 * Creature — Vampire Shaman
 * 2/2
 * Whenever this creature or another Vampire you control dies, you may pay {B}. If you do,
 *   target player loses 2 life and you gain 2 life.
 *
 * Canonical printing lives in Worldwake (the earliest real printing); Foundations is a
 * [com.wingedsheep.sdk.model.Printing] row (see `.../definitions/fdn/cards/KalastriaHighbornReprint.kt`).
 *
 * "This creature or another Vampire you control" is exactly "a Vampire you control" — the source is
 * itself a Vampire — so the trigger is a Vampire-filtered dies event with [TriggerBinding.ANY], which
 * fires off the source's own death via last-known information. The target player is chosen when the
 * ability goes on the stack; the {B} payment is the resolution-time gate ([MayPayManaEffect]) for the
 * drain.
