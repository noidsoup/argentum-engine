 * Black Sun's Zenith — Mirrodin Besieged #39 (canonical / earliest real printing, 2011)

 * Put X -1/-1 counters on each creature. Shuffle Black Sun's Zenith into its owner's library.
 *
 * Darkness Descends' shape (`ForEachInGroup` over `GroupFilter.AllCreatures`, `EffectTarget.Self`
 * rebound to each creature in turn) with the fixed count swapped for the dynamic one. Counters
 * rather than a -X/-X effect is the whole point of the card: they stick past end of turn, and a
 * creature reduced to 0 toughness dies to state-based actions.
