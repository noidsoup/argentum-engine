/**
 * Lunarch Mantle
 * {1}{W}
 * Enchantment — Aura
 * Enchant creature
 * Enchanted creature gets +2/+2 and has "{1}, Sacrifice a permanent: This creature gains flying
 * until end of turn."
 *
 * The +2/+2 is a static [ModifyStats] on the attached creature. The granted activated ability is a
 * [GrantActivatedAbility] static whose [EffectTarget.Self] resolves to the host creature (CR 113.7),
 * so "{1}, Sacrifice a permanent" grants flying until end of turn to the enchanted creature itself.
 *
 * The sacrifice filter is spelled [GameObjectFilter.Permanent] rather than left at `Costs.Sacrifice`'s
 * `Any` default: the printed noun is "a permanent", and the two agree only because a sacrifice cost
 * can reach nothing but the battlefield anyway.
