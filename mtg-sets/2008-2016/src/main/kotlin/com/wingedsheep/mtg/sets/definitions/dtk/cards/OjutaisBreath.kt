/**
 * Ojutai's Breath
 * {2}{U}
 * Instant
 *
 * Tap target creature. It doesn't untap during its controller's next untap step.
 * Rebound (If you cast this spell from your hand, exile it as it resolves. At the beginning of your next upkeep, you may cast this card from exile without paying its mana cost.)
 *
 * The same two-step construction as Crippling Chill: [Effects.Tap], then the
 * [AbilityFlag.DOESNT_UNTAP] grant held for [Duration.UntilAfterAffectedControllersNextUntap].
 * That duration is keyed to the *affected* creature's controller, not this spell's — which is what
 * "its controller's next untap step" says, and what makes the freeze land correctly when the
 * creature belongs to someone whose untap step comes before yours.
 *
 * The second line is the bare [Keyword.REBOUND]; `StackResolver` reads it off `cardDef.keywords`.
