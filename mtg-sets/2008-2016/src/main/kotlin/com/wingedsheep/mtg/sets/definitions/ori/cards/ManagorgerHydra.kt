 * Managorger Hydra

 * Creature — Hydra
 * 1/1
 * Trample
 * Whenever a player casts a spell, put a +1/+1 counter on this creature.
 *
 * The whole card is one cast watcher scoped to *every* player: [Triggers.AnyPlayerCastsSpell] is the
 * `Player.Each` form of the spell-cast event, so the Hydra grows off opponents' spells as well as
 * your own — the untargeted, self-directed [Effects.AddCounters] needs no target plumbing.
