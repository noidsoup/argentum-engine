 * The [SuppressEntersTriggers] static (default `filter = Creature`): when a creature enters the
 * battlefield, no triggered ability fires from that entry — neither the creature's own
 * enters-the-battlefield triggers nor any other permanent's "whenever a [...] enters" trigger that
 * the creature would cause. Replacement effects (enters with counters / tapped) and "as it enters"
 * choices are unaffected, matching the printed rulings.
