/**

 * 2/2

 * Haste
 * Selfie Shot — Whenever you cast a noncreature spell, if at least four mana was spent to cast it,
 * create a Treasure token.
 *
 * "Selfie Shot" is an ability word (flavor only — no rules meaning). "If at least four mana was
 * spent to cast it" is an intervening-if on the noncreature-cast trigger, modeled by
 * [Conditions.TriggeringSpellManaSpentAtLeast] reading the triggering spell's recorded total mana
 * paid — so an {X} spell that paid four or more qualifies, while a four-mana-value spell cast for
 * less (cost reduction) does not. Shares its trigger shape with Sahagin.
