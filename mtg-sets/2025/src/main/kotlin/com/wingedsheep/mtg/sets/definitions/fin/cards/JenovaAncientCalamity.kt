/**
 * Jenova, Ancient Calamity — Final Fantasy #228
 * {2}{B}{G}
 * Legendary Creature — Alien
 * 1/5
 *
 * At the beginning of combat on your turn, put a number of +1/+1 counters equal to Jenova's
 * power on up to one other target creature. That creature becomes a Mutant in addition to its
 * other types.
 * Whenever a Mutant you control dies during your turn, you draw cards equal to its power.
 *
 * The combat trigger uses [Triggers.BeginCombat]; the target is "up to one other target
 * creature" — an optional single [TargetCreature] over [TargetFilter.OtherCreature]
 * (excludeSelf), so the whole effect no-ops when no target is chosen (cf. Ardyn, the Usurper).
 * The counter amount is [DynamicAmounts.sourcePower] (Jenova's current power) and the type
 * grant is a permanent [Effects.AddCreatureType] ("in addition to its other types").
 *
 * The dies payoff mirrors Rakdos Joins Up: a [Triggers.leavesBattlefield] (… to GRAVEYARD)
 * over Mutant creatures you control, gated to "during your turn" via
 * triggerRestriction = [Conditions.IsYourTurn]. The draw amount is [DynamicAmounts.triggeringPower],
 * which resolves via last-known information for the just-died creature.
