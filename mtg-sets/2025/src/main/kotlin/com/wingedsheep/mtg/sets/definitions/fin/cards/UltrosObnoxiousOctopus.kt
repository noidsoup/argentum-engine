/**
 * Ultros, Obnoxious Octopus
 * {1}{U}
 * Legendary Creature — Octopus
 * 2/1
 * Whenever you cast a noncreature spell, if at least four mana was spent to cast it, tap
 *   target creature an opponent controls and put a stun counter on it.
 * Whenever you cast a noncreature spell, if at least eight mana was spent to cast it, put
 *   eight +1/+1 counters on Ultros.
 *
 * Two independent cast triggers, each an intervening-"if" on the mana actually paid for the
 * triggering spell ([Conditions.TriggeringSpellManaSpentAtLeast] — same primitive as Sahagin,
 * so an {X} spell paying the threshold qualifies while a lower-cost spell with a high mana
 * value does not). Both can fire off one eight-mana spell. Per Scryfall ruling, each ability
 * resolves before the triggering spell, and still resolves even if that spell is countered.
 *   - ≥4: tap [Targets.CreatureOpponentControls] and add a stun counter (CR 122 / 701 stun).
 *   - ≥8: add eight +1/+1 counters to Ultros ([EffectTarget.Self]); non-targeting.
