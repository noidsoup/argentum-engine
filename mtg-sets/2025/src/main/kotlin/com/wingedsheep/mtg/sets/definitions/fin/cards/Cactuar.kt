 * Creature — Plant
 * 3/3
 *
 * Trample
 * At the beginning of your end step, if this creature didn't enter the battlefield this turn,
 * return it to its owner's hand.
 *
 * Intervening-if (CR 603.4): the bounce trigger only fires if Cactuar didn't enter this turn —
 * modeled as the negation of [Conditions.SourceEnteredThisTurn]. The condition is re-checked at
 * resolution, so a Cactuar that entered this turn is left alone (it can attack and stay for the
 * turn it arrives, then bounces on a later end step).
