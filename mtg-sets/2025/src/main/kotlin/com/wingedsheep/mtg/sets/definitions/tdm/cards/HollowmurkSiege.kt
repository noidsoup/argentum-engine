/**
 * Hollowmurk Siege
 * {B}{G}
 * Enchantment
 *
 * As this enchantment enters, choose Sultai or Abzan.
 * • Sultai — Whenever a counter is put on a creature you control, draw a card.
 *   This ability triggers only once each turn.
 * • Abzan — Whenever you attack, put a +1/+1 counter on target attacking creature.
 *   It gains menace until end of turn.
 *
 * Implementation: the cast-time choice is recorded via [EntersWithChoice] (ChoiceType.MODE).
 * Both modes are triggered abilities gated by [SourceChosenModeIs]. The Sultai trigger uses
 * [Triggers.countersPlacedOn] (any counter type, on a creature you control, not restricted to
 * a per-creature first time) plus `oncePerTurn = true` for the "triggers only once each turn"
 * clause.
