/**
 * The Prima Vista
 * {4}{U}
 * Legendary Artifact — Vehicle
 * 5/3
 * Flying
 * Whenever you cast a noncreature spell, if at least four mana was spent to cast it, The Prima
 * Vista becomes an artifact creature until end of turn.
 * Crew 2 (Tap any number of creatures you control with total power 2 or more: This Vehicle becomes
 * an artifact creature until end of turn.)
 *
 * "If at least four mana was spent to cast it" is an intervening-if on the cast trigger (CR 603.4),
 * modeled by [Conditions.TriggeringSpellManaSpentAtLeast] reading the triggering spell's recorded
 * total mana paid (so {X} spells that paid four or more qualify, while a four-mana-value spell cast
 * for less does not). The payoff animates the source via [Effects.BecomeCreature] on
 * [EffectTarget.Self] with `Duration.EndOfTurn`: it keeps its Artifact type and Vehicle subtype and
 * simply gains the CREATURE type with its printed 5/3 — the same animation Crew produces.
