/**
 * Sahagin
 * {1}{U}
 * Creature — Merfolk Warrior
 * 1/3
 * Whenever you cast a noncreature spell, if at least four mana was spent to cast it, put a
 * +1/+1 counter on this creature and it can't be blocked this turn.
 *
 * "If at least four mana was spent to cast it" is an intervening-if on the cast trigger,
 * modeled by the new [Conditions.TriggeringSpellManaSpentAtLeast] reading the triggering
 * spell's recorded total mana paid (so {X} spells that paid four or more qualify, while a
 * four-mana-value spell cast for less does not). The payoff adds a +1/+1 counter to this
 * creature and grants it CANT_BE_BLOCKED for the turn.
