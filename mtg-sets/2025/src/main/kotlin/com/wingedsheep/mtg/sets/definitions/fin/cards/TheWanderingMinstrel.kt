/**
 * The Wandering Minstrel — {G}{U} Legendary Creature — Human Bard (1/3).
 *
 * - "Lands you control enter untapped." — a static [EntersUntapped] replacement effect consulted
 *   from the battlefield whenever a land the Minstrel's controller controls would enter tapped
 *   (the inverse of [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.EntersTapped]). Per CR 614 ordering this
 *   overrides a land's own "enters tapped" replacement (controller chooses untapped) and a land
 *   merely put onto the battlefield tapped (no replacement) enters untapped.
 * - "The Minstrel's Ballad" — a begin-combat-on-your-turn trigger with an intervening-if
 *   ([interveningIf], Rule 603.4): it both fails to trigger and fails to resolve unless you
 *   control five or more Towns at that moment.
 * - The activated pump locks X (number of Towns you control) once as it resolves, since
 *   [Effects.ModifyStats] with a [DynamicAmount] evaluates to a fixed +X/+X floating effect.
