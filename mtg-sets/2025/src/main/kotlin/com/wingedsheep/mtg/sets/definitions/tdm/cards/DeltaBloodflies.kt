/**
 * Delta Bloodflies — Tarkir: Dragonstorm #77
 * {1}{B} · Creature — Insect · 1/2
 *
 * Flying
 * Whenever this creature attacks, if you control a creature with a counter on it, each opponent
 * loses 1 life.
 *
 * The attack trigger carries an intervening-if condition (Rule 603.4) via `interveningIf`:
 * [Conditions.YouControl] over `GameObjectFilter.Creature.withAnyCounter()` ("a creature with a
 * counter on it"). The condition is checked both when the ability would trigger and again on
 * resolution, so removing the last counter before resolution fizzles the life loss. The payoff is
 * [Effects.LoseLife] aimed at [Player.EachOpponent].
