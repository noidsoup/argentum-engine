/**
 * Sidequest: Play Blitzball // World Champion, Celestial Weapon — Final Fantasy #158
 * {2}{R} · Enchantment // Legendary Artifact — Equipment
 *
 * Front — Sidequest: Play Blitzball:
 *   At the beginning of combat on your turn, target creature you control gets +2/+0 until end of turn.
 *   At the end of combat on your turn, if a player was dealt 6 or more combat damage this turn,
 *   transform this enchantment, then attach it to a creature you control.
 *
 * Back — World Champion, Celestial Weapon:
 *   Double Overdrive — Equipped creature gets +2/+0 and has double strike.
 *   Equip {3}
 *
 * The end-of-combat ability is an intervening-"if": the 6-combat-damage check gates the whole
 * trigger, and "a player" is existential over every player (including you) — modelled by
 * [Conditions.aPlayerWasDealtCombatDamageThisTurnAtLeast], which reads a per-player combat-damage
 * running total rather than summing every player together. On resolution it transforms (turning
 * this permanent into the Equipment), then chooses a creature you control to attach to. The attach
 * is a resolution-time choice, NOT a target: the pipeline's `selectTarget` auto-picks a lone
 * creature, pauses to choose among several, and — crucially — no-ops when you control none, so the
 * enchantment still transforms even if you have no creature to hold the weapon.
