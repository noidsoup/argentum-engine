/**
 * Fire Nation Raider
 * {3}{R}
 * Creature — Human Soldier
 * 4/2
 *
 * Raid — When this creature enters, if you attacked this turn, create a Clue token. (It's an
 * artifact with "{2}, Sacrifice this token: Draw a card.")
 *
 * Raid is modeled as an intervening-if on a [Triggers.EntersBattlefield] triggered ability via
 * [Conditions.YouAttackedThisTurn] (checked both when the trigger would go on the stack and again
 * on resolution, CR 603.4). The reward is the predefined Clue token via [Effects.CreateClue].
