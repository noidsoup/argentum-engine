/**
 * Suki, Courageous Rescuer
 * {1}{W}{W}
 * Legendary Creature — Human Warrior Ally
 * 2/4
 *
 * Other creatures you control get +1/+0.
 * Whenever another permanent you control leaves the battlefield during your turn, create a 1/1
 * white Ally creature token. This ability triggers only once each turn.
 *
 * The anthem is a static [ModifyStats] over [GroupFilter] creatures-you-control with
 * `excludeSelf` (so Suki doesn't pump herself). The leave-the-battlefield trigger reuses the
 * generic [Triggers.leavesBattlefield] factory with an `OTHER` binding ("another permanent you
 * control"), gated to your turn via [Conditions.IsYourTurn] and limited to a single firing per
 * turn with `oncePerTurn` (same shell as Moonstone Harbinger).
