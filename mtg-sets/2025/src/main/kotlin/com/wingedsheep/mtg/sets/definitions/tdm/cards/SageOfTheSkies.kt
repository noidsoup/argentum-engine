/**
 * Sage of the Skies — Tarkir: Dragonstorm #22
 * {2}{W} · Creature — Human Monk · 2/3
 *
 * When you cast this spell, if you've cast another spell this turn, copy this spell.
 * (The copy becomes a token.)
 * Flying, lifelink
 *
 * The cast trigger fires from the stack via [Triggers.WhenYouCastThisSpell]. The intervening
 * "if" (CR 603.4) is `Conditions.YouCastSpellsThisTurn(atLeast = 2)`: the spell itself is already
 * counted when its own cast trigger is checked, so "two or more" means "you've cast another spell
 * this turn". `Effects.CopyTargetSpell(TriggeringEntity)` copies the triggering spell (the same
 * primitive Taigam, Master Opportunist uses) — since Sage is a permanent spell the copy resolves
 * into a token (CR 707.10f), and because a copy is put on the stack rather than cast (CR 707.10),
 * it does not re-trigger this ability.
