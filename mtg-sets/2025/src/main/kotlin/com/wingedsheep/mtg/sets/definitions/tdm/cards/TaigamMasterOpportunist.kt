/**
 * Taigam, Master Opportunist — Tarkir: Dragonstorm #60
 * {1}{U} · Legendary Creature — Human Monk · 2/2
 *
 * Flurry — Whenever you cast your second spell each turn, copy it, then exile the spell you
 * cast with four time counters on it. If it doesn't have suspend, it gains suspend. (At the
 * beginning of its owner's upkeep, they remove a time counter. When the last is removed,
 * they may play it without paying its mana cost. If it's a creature, it has haste.)
 *
 * Composed from atomic primitives rather than a bespoke executor:
 *
 *   1. **Copy it** — [Effects.CopyTargetSpell] on [EffectTarget.TriggeringEntity] (the spell
 *      you cast, exactly as Alania, Divergent Storm copies its triggering spell). The copy is
 *      created on the stack and resolves normally.
 *   2. **Exile the spell you cast** — a [CounterEffect] to [CounterDestination.Exile] removes
 *      the original spell from the stack into its owner's exile (a spell can't be lifted off
 *      the stack with a zone-move effect; it must be countered/exiled).
 *   3. **Give it suspend** — [Effects.Suspend] puts four time counters on the now-exiled card
 *      and marks it suspended. The owner's-upkeep countdown that plays it for free is supplied
 *      by the engine off that marker, so no card-specific cast logic lives here (see
 *      [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.Suspend]).
 *
 * "If it doesn't have suspend, it gains suspend" — Taigam only ever exiles freshly-cast
 * spells, none of which have suspend, so the conditional is always the grant.
