/**
 * Kheru Goldkeeper — Tarkir: Dragonstorm #199
 * {1}{B}{G}{U} · Creature — Dragon · 3/3
 *
 * Flying
 * Whenever one or more cards leave your graveyard during your turn, create a Treasure token.
 * Renew — {2}{B}{G}{U}, Exile this card from your graveyard: Put two +1/+1 counters and a
 *   flying counter on target creature. Activate only as a sorcery.
 *
 * The leave-graveyard trigger reuses the batching [Triggers.CardsLeaveYourGraveyard] (fires once
 * per event batch) gated on [Conditions.IsYourTurn] for the "during your turn" restriction — the
 * same composition as Attuned Hunter. The renew payoff puts both counter kinds on a single target
 * via two chained [Effects.AddCounters] calls; the flying counter is a keyword counter (CR 122.1c),
 * already wired into `StateProjector.KEYWORD_COUNTER_MAP` so the creature gains Flying via projection.
