/**
 * Ran and Shaw
 * {3}{R}{R}
 * Legendary Creature — Dragon
 * 4/4
 *
 * Flying, firebending 2
 * When Ran and Shaw enter, if you cast them and there are three or more Dragon and/or Lesson cards
 *   in your graveyard, create a token that's a copy of Ran and Shaw, except it's not legendary.
 * {3}{R}: Dragons you control get +2/+0 until end of turn.
 *
 * The ETB is an intervening-if (CR 603.4): `interveningIf` gates on both "if you cast them"
 * ([Conditions.WasCast]) and the graveyard count, checked when the ability would trigger and again
 * on resolution. The copy uses the new `removeLegendary` clause on [Effects.CreateTokenCopyOfSelf]
 * ("except it's not legendary"). "Dragon and/or Lesson cards" is a single subtype-OR filter, so a
 * card that is both is still counted once.
