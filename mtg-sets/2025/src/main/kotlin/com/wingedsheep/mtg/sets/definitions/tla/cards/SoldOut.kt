 * (It's an artifact with "{2}, Sacrifice this token: Draw a card.")
 *
 * The "if it was dealt damage this turn" clause is evaluated while the creature is
 * still on the battlefield — exiling it would clear its damage tracking — so the Clue
 * branch runs first, then the exile. Both happen in the same resolution, so the order
