 * When this creature enters, you may sacrifice an artifact or creature. If you do, draw a card.

 * "Another creature you control dies" is `Triggers.leavesBattlefield` with an OTHER binding
 * (excludes this creature itself). The intervening "if it had counters on it" (CR 603.4) is
 * `Conditions.TriggeringEntityHadCounters`, reading the dying creature's last-known counters.
 * `Effects.MoveAllLastKnownCounters` moves *every* counter kind from the dying creature onto
 * this creature (the destination, [EffectTarget.Self]).
