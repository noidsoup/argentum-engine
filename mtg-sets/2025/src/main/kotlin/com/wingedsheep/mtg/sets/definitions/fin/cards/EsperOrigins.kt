/**
 * Esper Origins // Summon: Esper Maduin — Final Fantasy #185
 * {1}{G} · Sorcery
 * // Enchantment Creature — Saga Elemental 4/4
 *
 * Front — Esper Origins:
 *   Surveil 2. You gain 2 life. If this spell was cast from a graveyard, exile it, then put it
 *   onto the battlefield transformed under its owner's control with a finality counter on it.
 *   Flashback {3}{G}
 *
 * Back — Summon: Esper Maduin:
 *   (As this Saga enters and after your draw step, add a lore counter. Sacrifice after III.)
 *   I — Reveal the top card of your library. If it's a permanent card, put it into your hand.
 *   II — Add {G}{G}.
 *   III — Other creatures you control get +2/+2 and gain trample until end of turn.
 *
 * Cast normally, the front is an ordinary sorcery that surveils and gains life, then goes to the
 * graveyard. Flashed back (or otherwise cast from a graveyard), the same resolution instead exiles
 * the card and returns it to the battlefield transformed as the back-face Saga with a finality
 * counter — modelled by [com.wingedsheep.sdk.model.CardScript.returnTransformedFromGraveyardOnResolve]
 * (the `returnTransformedFromGraveyard` spell-builder marker). The destination is derived from the
 * spell's cast-from zone at resolution time, exactly like flashback's own graveyard-cast exile, so
 * it survives the mid-resolution pause of Surveil and takes precedence over the flashback exile.
 * The finality counter (CR 122.1h — "if it would die, exile it instead") keeps the loop from
 * refilling the graveyard for another flashback.
