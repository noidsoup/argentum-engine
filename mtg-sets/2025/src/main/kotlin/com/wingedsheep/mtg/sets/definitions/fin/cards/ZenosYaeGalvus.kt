/**
 * Zenos yae Galvus // Shinryu, Transcendent Rival (Final Fantasy #127)
 * {3}{B}{B} — Legendary Creature — Human Noble Warrior 4/4
 * //  — Legendary Creature — Dragon 8/8 (Flying)
 *
 * Front — Zenos yae Galvus:
 *   My First Friend — When Zenos yae Galvus enters, choose a creature an opponent controls. Until
 *   end of turn, creatures other than Zenos yae Galvus and the chosen creature get -2/-2.
 *   When the chosen creature leaves the battlefield, transform Zenos yae Galvus.
 *
 * Back — Shinryu, Transcendent Rival:
 *   Flying
 *   As this creature transforms into Shinryu, choose an opponent.
 *   Burning Chains — When the chosen player loses the game, you win the game.
 *
 * Modeling notes:
 *  - "choose a creature an opponent controls" is a non-targeting choice. Per the card's ruling,
 *    when you *can't* choose one (opponents control no creatures) the -2/-2 still resolves for
 *    every other creature. A mandatory target would remove the whole triggered ability from the
 *    stack in that case (CR 603.3c), so we model the choice as an **optional** target: the -2/-2
 *    `ForEachInGroup` runs regardless, and only the delayed transform-watch is created when a
 *    creature was actually chosen. (The one divergence from a true non-targeting choice — the
 *    engine has no "choose one if able" primitive — is that a player could decline while an
 *    opponent creature exists, and hexproof creatures can't be chosen.)
 *  - The -2/-2 is a one-shot [ModifyStatsEffect] applied to `AllCreatures.other().otherThanTarget()`
 *    — every creature except the source (Zenos) and the chosen target — mirroring Infest.
 *  - "When the chosen creature leaves the battlefield, transform Zenos" is a reflexive delayed
 *    trigger scoped to the chosen creature ([Triggers.LeavesBattlefield] + `watchedTarget`). It
 *    must survive across turns until that creature leaves, so it uses [DelayedTriggerExpiry.Never]
 *    with `fireOnce` (the end-of-turn cleanup only removes EndOfTurn triggers). `EffectTarget.Self`
 *    resolves to the delayed trigger's source — Zenos — when it fires.
 *  - The back's win condition is a broad [Triggers.AnyPlayerLosesGame] gated to the chosen player
 *    via `triggerRestriction = TriggeringPlayerIs(Player.ChosenOpponent)`; [Effects.ChooseOpponent]
 *    (on [Triggers.TransformsToBack]) stores that opponent, and only an actual transform sets it.
