/**
 * Redirect Lightning
 * {R}
 * Instant — Lesson
 *
 * As an additional cost to cast this spell, pay 5 life or pay {2}.
 * Change the target of target spell or ability with a single target.
 *
 * The binary additional-cost fork (pay 5 life or pay {2}) is modeled with [ModalEffect],
 * mirroring Bitter Triumph's "discard a card or pay 3 life" and Deadly Precision's
 * "pay {4} or sacrifice" patterns. The spell is NOT modal in MTG terms (no "Choose one —"
 * wording), so countsAsModalSpell = false. Both modes carry the same retarget effect.
 *
 * [Effects.ChangeTarget] + [Targets.SpellOrAbilityWithSingleTarget] is the Willbender /
 * Return the Favor retarget; the single-target restriction is enforced at resolution by
 * the change-target executor.
