/**
 * Genji Glove
 * {5}
 * Artifact — Equipment
 * Equipped creature has double strike.
 * Whenever equipped creature attacks, if it's the first combat phase of the turn, untap it.
 *   After this phase, there is an additional combat phase.
 * Equip {3}
 *
 * Mirrors the Raph & Leo / Éomer shape: attack trigger with an anti-infinite-loop limiter,
 * untap the attacker, then [Effects.AddCombatPhase] to add a second combat phase (combat only,
 * no trailing main phase). The trigger binds to the attached creature via [TriggerBinding.ATTACHED],
 * and "untap it" untaps that same equipped creature via [EffectTarget.EquippedCreature].
 *
 * **Approximation note:** the printed rider is *"if it's the first combat phase of the turn"*
 * (intervening-if), but the engine has no "first combat phase" condition today. The same
 * anti-infinite-loop function is served by `oncePerTurn = true`; the two diverge only in a narrow
 * edge case (another source of additional combat exists *and* the equipped creature first attacks
 * in combat #2 — the intervening-if would fail, `oncePerTurn = true` would still let it fire once).
 * When a `Conditions.IsFirstCombatPhase` primitive lands, swap `oncePerTurn = true` for a faithful
 * `triggerRestriction`.
