/**
 * Host of the Hereafter — Tarkir: Dragonstorm #193
 * {2}{B}{G} · Creature — Zombie Warlock · 2/2
 *
 * This creature enters with two +1/+1 counters on it.
 * Whenever this creature or another creature you control dies, if it had counters on it,
 * put its counters on up to one target creature you control.
 *
 * "This creature or another creature you control dies" is `Triggers.YourCreatureDies`
 * (ANY binding, creatures-you-control filter — which includes Host itself). The intervening
 * "if it had counters on it" (CR 603.4) is `Conditions.TriggeringEntityHadCounters`, reading
 * the dying creature's last-known total counter count. `Effects.MoveAllLastKnownCounters`
 * moves *every* counter kind from the dying creature (not just +1/+1) onto the chosen target,
 * which is optional ("up to one").
