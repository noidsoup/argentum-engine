/**
 * Fire Nation Engineer
 * {2}{B}
 * Creature — Human Artificer
 * 2/3
 *
 * Raid — At the beginning of your end step, if you attacked this turn, put a +1/+1 counter
 * on another target creature or Vehicle you control.
 *
 * Raid is modeled as an intervening-if on a [Triggers.YourEndStep] triggered ability via
 * [Conditions.YouAttackedThisTurn] (checked both when the trigger would go on the stack and again
 * on resolution, CR 603.4). "Another target creature or Vehicle you control" is a
 * [GameObjectFilter.CreatureOrVehicle] permanent target restricted to your control with
 * `excludeSelf` ("another"); a Vehicle is matched by its subtype even while it isn't a creature.
