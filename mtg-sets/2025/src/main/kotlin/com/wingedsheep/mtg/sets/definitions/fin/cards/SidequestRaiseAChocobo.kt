/**
 * Sidequest: Raise a Chocobo // Black Chocobo — Final Fantasy #201
 * {1}{G} · Enchantment // Creature — Bird · 2/2
 *
 * Front — Sidequest: Raise a Chocobo:
 *   When this enchantment enters, create a 2/2 green Bird creature token with "Whenever a
 *   land you control enters, this token gets +1/+0 until end of turn."
 *   At the beginning of your first main phase, if you control four or more Birds,
 *   transform this enchantment.
 *
 * Back — Black Chocobo:
 *   When this permanent transforms into Black Chocobo, search your library for a land card,
 *   put it onto the battlefield tapped, then shuffle.
 *   Landfall — Whenever a land you control enters, Birds you control get +1/+0 until end of turn.
 *
 * The token (same one Chocobo Racetrack makes) carries a granted landfall trigger via
 * [CreateTokenEffect.triggeredAbilities]. The first-main transform is an intervening-"if"
 * over the number of Birds you control.
