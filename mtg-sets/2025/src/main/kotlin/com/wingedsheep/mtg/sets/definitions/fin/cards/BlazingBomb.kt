/**
 * Blazing Bomb
 * {R}
 * Creature — Elemental
 * 1/1
 * Whenever you cast a noncreature spell, if at least four mana was spent to cast it, put a +1/+1
 * counter on this creature.
 * Blow Up — {T}, Sacrifice this creature: It deals damage equal to its power to target creature.
 * Activate only as a sorcery.
 *
 * The cast trigger uses an intervening-if (CR 603.4) comparing the *triggering* spell's mana spent
 * (`ContextProperty(MANA_SPENT_ON_TRIGGERING_SPELL)`) to 4 — distinct from `TotalManaSpent`, which
 * reads the resolving object's own cast.
 *
 * Blow Up sacrifices the source as part of its cost, so the creature is gone by the time the ability
 * resolves. `DynamicAmounts.sourcePower()` reads the source's **last-known** power (captured at
 * cost-payment time, CR 112.7a / 608.2h), so a buffed Bomb deals its accumulated power rather than 0.
