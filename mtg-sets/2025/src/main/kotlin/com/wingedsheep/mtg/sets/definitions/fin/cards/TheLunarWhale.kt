/**
 * The Lunar Whale
 * {3}{U}
 * Legendary Artifact — Vehicle
 * 3/5
 *
 * Flying
 * You may look at the top card of your library any time.
 * As long as The Lunar Whale attacked this turn, you may play the top card of your library.
 * Crew 1
 *
 * The "play the top card" permission is non-revealing — only the controller sees the top card
 * (via [LookAtTopOfLibrary]); it is NOT publicly revealed like Future Sight's
 * [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.PlayFromTopOfLibrary]. "Play the top card" (any card type) is
 * modeled as [PlayLandsAndCastFilteredFromTopOfLibrary] with an unrestricted [GameObjectFilter.Any]
 * spell filter — play lands and cast any spell from the top — gated by a
 * [Conditions.SourceAttackedThisTurn] conditional static so the permission only applies after the
 * Whale has attacked this turn.
