/**
 * Iroh, Grand Lotus {3}{G}{U}{R} — Legendary Creature — Human Noble Ally (5/5)
 *  - Firebending 2
 *  - "During your turn, each non-Lesson instant and sorcery card in your graveyard has flashback.
 *     The flashback cost is equal to that card's mana cost."
 *  - "During your turn, each Lesson card in your graveyard has flashback {1}."
 *
 * The two clauses are whole-graveyard flashback grants ([GraveyardCardsHaveFlashback], CR 702.34):
 * a continuous static that grants flashback to *every* matching card in your graveyard, gated to
 * your turn. These tests pin: a non-Lesson instant/sorcery becomes castable from the graveyard for
 * its own mana cost (and is exiled on resolution — flashback); a Lesson becomes castable for {1};
 * the grant is off on an opponent's turn and absent without Iroh; and non-instant/sorcery cards
 * (creatures) are never granted flashback.
