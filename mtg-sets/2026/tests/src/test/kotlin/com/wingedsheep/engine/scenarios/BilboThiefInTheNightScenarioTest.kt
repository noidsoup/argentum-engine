/**
 * Bilbo, Thief in the Night — {1}{U} Legendary Creature — Halfling Rogue (The Hobbit #33).
 *
 *  - "Spells you cast from anywhere other than your hand cost {1} less to cast."
 *  - "Whenever Bilbo attacks, you may cast an artifact, instant, or sorcery spell from your
 *    graveyard. If an instant or sorcery spell cast this way would be put into your graveyard,
 *    exile it instead."
 *
 * The second ability is a turn-long `MayCastFromGraveyard` grant (the Forgotten Cellar path) plus
 * the new `exileInsteadOfGraveyard` cast-this-way rider. These tests pin the three things that could
 * silently regress: the zone scope of the cost reduction, the attack gate on the permission, and the
 * fact that the exile rider follows the *authorizing grant* rather than the graveyard zone.
