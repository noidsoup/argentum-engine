/**
 * Moseo, Vein's New Dean — Secrets of Strixhaven #91
 * {2}{B} · Legendary Creature — Bird Skeleton Warlock · 2/1
 *
 * Flying
 * When Moseo enters, create a 1/1 black and green Pest creature token with
 * "Whenever this token attacks, you gain 1 life."
 * Infusion — At the beginning of your end step, if you gained life this turn, return up to one
 * target creature card with mana value X or less from your graveyard to the battlefield, where X
 * is the amount of life you gained this turn.
 *
 * The ETB Pest is the set-standard token (its own self-attack life-gain trigger via
 * [CreateTokenEffect.triggeredAbilities]), shared with Essenceknit Scholar / Send in the Pest.
 *
 * Infusion is an ability word (no rules meaning) flavoring the end-step trigger. It is gated by an
 * intervening-if on [Conditions.YouGainedLifeThisTurn] (CR 603.4 — checked both when it would trigger
 * and again on resolution). The reanimation is an "up to one target" ([TargetObject] with
 * `optional = true`) creature card in **your** graveyard whose mana value is at most the amount of
 * life you gained this turn — the dynamic cap `manaValueAtMostDynamic(TurnTracking(You, LIFE_GAINED))`.
 * [Effects.PutOntoBattlefield] reanimates the chosen card under the controller's control.
