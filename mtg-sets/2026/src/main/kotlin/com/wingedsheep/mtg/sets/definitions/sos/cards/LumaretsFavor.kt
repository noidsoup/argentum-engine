/**
 * Lumaret's Favor — Secrets of Strixhaven #153
 * {1}{G} · Instant
 *
 * Infusion — When you cast this spell, copy it if you gained life this turn. You may choose new
 * targets for the copy.
 * Target creature gets +2/+4 until end of turn.
 *
 * Infusion here is an intervening-"if" cast trigger (CR 603.4) — the copy-spell sibling of
 * Social Snub, but the copy is **mandatory** (not "you may") and gated on the Infusion condition
 * `Conditions.YouGainedLifeThisTurn`. `Triggers.WhenYouCastThisSpell()` fires from the stack while
 * the spell is still on it; `Effects.CopyTargetSpell(TriggeringEntity)` copies the triggering spell
 * and offers new targets for the copy by default (a copy isn't cast, CR 707.10, so it doesn't
 * re-trigger Infusion). The main spell is the plain `Effects.ModifyStats(2, 4, …)` end-of-turn pump.
