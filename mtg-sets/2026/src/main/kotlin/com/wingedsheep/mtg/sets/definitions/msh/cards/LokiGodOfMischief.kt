/**
 * Loki, God of Mischief — Marvel Super Heroes #65 (rare)
 * {1}{U} · Legendary Creature — God Sorcerer Villain · 2/1
 *
 * Whenever a player or permanent becomes the target of an ability you control, draw a card.
 * This ability triggers only once each turn.
 *
 * Three separate narrowings of one trigger, all of them data on
 * [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.EventPattern.BecomesTargetEvent]:
 *
 *  - **"an ability"** (not a spell) is `abilitiesOnly`, the mirror of the `spellsOnly` that King of
 *    the Oathbreakers already used. Both activated and triggered abilities count — the engine stamps
 *    `sourceIsSpell` on the event from whichever `StackResolver` entry point put the object on the
 *    stack, and only the cast/spell-copy paths set it.
 *  - **"a player or permanent"** is `includePlayerTargets`. Player targets are opt-in on the trigger
 *    side because every other becomes-target wording in the pool is about objects; without the flag
 *    a targeted player matches nothing (see `TriggerMatcher.matchesBecomesTargetTrigger`).
 *  - **"you control"** is `byYou`, compared against the ability's controller, so an opponent
 *    targeting their own creature with their own ability does nothing here.
 *
 * "This ability triggers only once each turn" is `oncePerTurn` on the triggered ability: the cap is
 * spent by the first trigger, so a second targeting ability in the same turn never puts an ability on
 * the stack at all (CR 603.2 — the ability triggers when the event occurs, and this rider stops it
 * from triggering again).
 *
 * The trigger fires at target *announcement* (CR 601.2c for spells; CR 602.2b / 603.3d for activated
 * and triggered abilities), not on resolution — so an ability whose target becomes illegal, or which
 * gets countered, still draws the card. Targeting is also literal (CR 115.10a): an ability that
 * merely affects a player without the word "target" does not trigger Loki.
