/**
 * Scheming Silvertongue // Sign in Blood — Secrets of Strixhaven #99
 * {1}{B} · Creature — Vampire Warlock · 1/3
 *
 * Flying, lifelink
 * At the beginning of your second main phase, if you gained 2 or more life this turn, this
 * creature becomes prepared. (While it's prepared, you may cast a copy of its spell. Doing so
 * unprepares it.)
 * //
 * Sign in Blood — {B}{B} · Sorcery: Target player draws two cards and loses 2 life.
 *
 * Prepare (Secrets of Strixhaven): Scheming Silvertongue does NOT enter prepared (no PREPARED
 * keyword). It becomes prepared via its postcombat-main intervening-if trigger (gained 2+ life
 * this turn) through [Effects.BecomePrepared]. Becoming prepared creates a copy of its prepare
 * spell ("Sign in Blood") in exile that its controller may cast for {B}{B}; casting that copy
 * unprepares the creature. Modeled via `CardLayout.PREPARE` + the `prepare(name) { }` DSL.
