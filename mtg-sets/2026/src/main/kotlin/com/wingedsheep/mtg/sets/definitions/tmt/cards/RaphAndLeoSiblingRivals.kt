/**
 * Raph & Leo, Sibling Rivals
 * {1}{R/W}{R/W}
 * Legendary Creature — Mutant Ninja Turtle
 * 2/4
 *
 * Whenever Raph & Leo attack, if it's the first combat phase of the
 * turn, untap one or two target attacking creatures. After this
 * phase, there is an additional combat phase.
 *
 * Mirrors the LTR Éomer, Marshal of Rohan shape — attack trigger
 * with an anti-loop limiter, untap a small group of attackers, then
 * `Effects.AddCombatPhase` to add a second combat phase (combat only,
 * no trailing main phase).
 *
 * **Approximation note:** the printed rider is *"if it's the first
 * combat phase of the turn"* (intervening-if), but the engine has no
 * "first combat phase" condition today. The same anti-infinite-loop
 * function is served by Éomer's `oncePerTurn = true` trigger-firing
 * cap; the two diverge only in a narrow edge case (another source of
 * additional combat exists *and* Raph & Leo first attack in combat
 * #2 — the intervening-if would fail, `oncePerTurn = true` would
 * still let it fire once). When a `Conditions.IsFirstCombatPhase`
 * primitive lands, swap `oncePerTurn = true` for a faithful
 * `triggerRestriction`.
