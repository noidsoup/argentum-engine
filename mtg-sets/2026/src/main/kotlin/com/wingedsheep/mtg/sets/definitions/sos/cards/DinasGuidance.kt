/**
 * Dina's Guidance — Secrets of Strixhaven #184
 * {1}{B}{G} · Instant
 *
 * Search your library for a creature card, reveal it, put it into your hand or graveyard, then
 * shuffle.
 *
 * A search tutor whose found card lands in a *player-chosen* zone (hand or graveyard). Modeled as
 * an atomic gather → choose → reveal → split-move pipeline:
 *   1. gather the creature cards in your library,
 *   2. `chooseUpTo(1)` — the search itself (a search may always fail to find, CR 701.19c),
 *   3. reveal the found card,
 *   4. a binary split over the found card — selecting it sends it to your **hand**, leaving it
 *      sends it to your **graveyard** (the "hand or graveyard" choice, with the card already
 *      revealed so the decision is made after seeing it),
 *   5. shuffle.
 * No new SDK surface: the zone choice is expressed with the existing split-selection primitive.
