/**
 * Kang the Conqueror — Marvel Super Heroes #62 (mythic)
 * {2}{U}{U} · Legendary Creature — Human Villain · 4/5
 *
 * Flying
 * Power-up — {5}{U}{U}{U}: Put a +1/+1 counter on Kang. Take an extra turn after this one. During
 * that turn, power-up abilities can't be activated. (Activate each power-up ability only once.
 * Reduce the cost by his mana cost if he entered this turn.)
 *
 * Everything but the last clause is stock: `isPowerUp` carries the once-per-object limit and the
 * pip-wise self-cost reduction (`{5}{U}{U}{U}` − `{2}{U}{U}` = `{3}{U}` the turn he lands), and the
 * counter plus the extra turn are `Effects.AddCounters` and `Effects.TakeExtraTurn`.
 *
 * The lockout is the `powerUpAbilitiesCantBeActivated` rider on [Effects.TakeExtraTurn] rather than
 * a separately sequenced effect, because "that turn" is the turn *that* effect creates. The engine
 * models Ugin's Nexus and other `PreventExtraTurns` sources as preventing the extra turn outright,
 * so when one is out there is no turn for the prohibition to bind to and it must not apply. Keeping
 * the rider on the effect keeps that precondition in its one legitimate owner instead of having a
 * sibling in the `Composite` re-derive it.
 *
 * The prohibition covers **every** player's power-up abilities, not just Kang's controller's, and
 * it outlives Kang: killing him in response to the ability, or during the extra turn, does not lift
 * it. The engine therefore records the extra turn's number in `GameState.powerUpRestrictedTurns`
 * instead of hanging a static ability off the permanent.
