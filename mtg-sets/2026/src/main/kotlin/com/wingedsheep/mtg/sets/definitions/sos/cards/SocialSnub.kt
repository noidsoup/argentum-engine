/**
 * Social Snub — Secrets of Strixhaven #228
 * {1}{W}{B} · Sorcery
 *
 * When you cast this spell while you control a creature, you may copy this spell.
 * Each player sacrifices a creature of their choice. Each opponent loses 1 life and you gain
 * 1 life.
 *
 * The intervening-if cast trigger (CR 603.4) fires from the stack via
 * [Triggers.WhenYouCastThisSpell] with `triggerRestriction = Conditions.ControlCreature`; its
 * [MayEffect] optionally copies the spell with [Effects.CopyTargetSpell] of the triggering entity
 * (a copy isn't cast, CR 707.10, so it doesn't re-trigger). Resolution is an edict —
 * [Effects.Sacrifice] of a creature for each player (`Player.Each`, each chooses their own) — then
 * each opponent loses 1 life and the controller gains 1.
