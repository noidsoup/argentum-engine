/**
 * Scolding Administrator — Secrets of Strixhaven #224
 * {W}{B} · Creature — Dwarf Cleric · 2/2
 *
 * Menace
 * Repartee — Whenever you cast an instant or sorcery spell that targets a creature, put a +1/+1
 *   counter on this creature.
 * When this creature dies, if it had counters on it, put those counters on up to one target
 *   creature.
 *
 * "Repartee" is an ability word (flavor only) shared with the other SOS Repartee cards — the
 * standard `youCastSpell(InstantOrSorcery)` narrowed by `targetsMatching(Creature)`. The dies
 * trigger is the Essence Channeler shape ([Effects.MoveAllLastKnownCounters] moves every counter
 * kind, not just +1/+1), gated by an intervening "if it had counters on it"
 * ([Conditions.TriggeringEntityHadCounters]) and targeting "up to one target creature"
 * (`TargetCreature(optional = true)`).
