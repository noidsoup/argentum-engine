/**
 * Ms. Marvel, Kamala Khan — Marvel Super Heroes #67 (rare)
 * {2}{U} · Legendary Creature — Mutant Inhuman Hero · 1/4
 *
 * Reach, vigilance
 * You have no maximum hand size.
 * Embiggen Fist — Whenever you cast a spell that targets a creature you control, draw a card.
 * Until end of turn, Ms. Marvel gains "Ms. Marvel's base power is equal to the number of cards in
 * your hand."
 *
 * Three of the four lines are existing vocabulary: the two keywords, [NoMaximumHandSize] (a
 * turn-based read in the cleanup step, not a Rule 613 continuous effect), and
 * [Triggers.youCastSpellTargeting] over `Creature.youControl()` — the same facade Iron Fist,
 * Mockingbird and Colleen Wing use in this set. Ms. Marvel is herself "a creature you control", so
 * a spell aimed at her arms the trigger too.
 *
 * The fourth line is the reason this card needed engine work. The granted clause must keep
 * *tracking* the hand for the rest of the turn — it is a quoted static ability, not a one-shot
 * number. `Effects.SetBasePower` used to evaluate its `DynamicAmount` once at resolution and stamp
 * a fixed value, which froze her power at whatever the hand happened to be. It now takes
 * `reevaluateContinuously = true`, which carries the `DynamicAmount` into the layer-7b floating
 * effect and re-reads it on every projection pass.
 *
 * Two rules notes on that clause:
 *  - It is **not** a characteristic-defining ability. CR 604.3a requires the ability to be printed
 *    on the card it affects (criterion 2) and to not be one the object grants to itself
 *    (criterion 4); this one fails both. So it applies in layer 7b — CR 613.4b, "effects that refer
 *    to the base power and/or toughness of a creature apply in this layer" — with the timestamp of
 *    the grant, rather than in layer 7a.
 *  - Only *power* is set. Her printed toughness of 4 is untouched, which is why the effect carries a
 *    null toughness rather than reusing the both-stats `SetBasePowerAndToughness`. Counters and pump
 *    spells are layer 7c and still apply on top.
 *
 * Ordering inside the trigger follows the printed text: draw first, then grant. Because the grant
 * re-evaluates, the drawn card is counted either way — the order is fidelity, not arithmetic.
