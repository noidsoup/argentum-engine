/**
 * Dark Leo & Shredder
 * {W}{B}
 * Legendary Creature — Mutant Ninja Turtle Human
 * 1/3
 *
 * Sneak {W}{B}
 * Attacking Ninjas you control have deathtouch.
 * Whenever Dark Leo & Shredder deal combat damage to a player, create a 1/1 black Ninja creature
 * token. Then if you control five or more Ninjas, that player loses half their life, rounded up.
 *
 * The deathtouch clause is a continuous static [GrantKeyword] over the group of attacking Ninjas
 * you control — only creatures attack, so the group is creatures with subtype Ninja that you
 * control and that are attacking, re-evaluated each application (same shape as Bone-Cairn Butcher).
 *
 * The combat-damage trigger creates the token first, then runs a [ConditionalEffect] gated on
 * [Conditions.YouControlAtLeast] 5 Ninjas: because the token is itself a Ninja and is created
 * before the check, it counts toward the five ("create … Then if you control five or more"). When
 * the gate holds, the damaged player ([Player.TriggeringPlayer]) loses half their own life rounded
 * up ([Effects.LoseHalfLife] with both `target` and `lifePlayer` pointed at that player).
