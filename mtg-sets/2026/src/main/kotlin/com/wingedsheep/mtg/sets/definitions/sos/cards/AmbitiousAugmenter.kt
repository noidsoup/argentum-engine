/**
 * Ambitious Augmenter
 * {G}
 * Creature — Turtle Wizard
 * 1/1
 *
 * Increment (Whenever you cast a spell, if the amount of mana you spent is greater than this
 * creature's power or toughness, put a +1/+1 counter on this creature.)
 * When this creature dies, if it had one or more counters on it, create a 0/0 green and blue
 * Fractal creature token, then put this creature's counters on that token.
 *
 * `increment()` is the SOS ability-word keyword (no real keyword added). The dies trigger uses
 * the intervening-if `Conditions.TriggeringEntityHadCounters` (CR 603.4 — reads the dying
 * creature's last-known total counter count). The effect composes two atomic facades: create the
 * 0/0 Fractal (published to the `CREATED_TOKENS` pipeline collection), then move *every* last-known
 * counter kind from the dying creature onto that just-created token via
 * `EffectTarget.PipelineTarget(CREATED_TOKENS, 0)`. Because the creature only ever bears +1/+1
 * counters from Increment, moving all last-known counters faithfully reproduces the printed wording.
