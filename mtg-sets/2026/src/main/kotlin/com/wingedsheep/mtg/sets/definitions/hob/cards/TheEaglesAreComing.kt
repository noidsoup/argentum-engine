/**
 * The Eagles Are Coming!
 * {1}{W}
 * Instant
 * Kicker {2}{W}{W}
 *
 * Choose target creature you own. If this spell was kicked, instead choose any number of target
 * creatures you own. Return each chosen creature to your hand. At the beginning of the next upkeep,
 * create a 4/4 white Bird Soldier creature token with flying for each creature returned to your
 * hand this way.
 *
 * The kicked cast swaps only the *targeting* (one creature → any number), never the effect, so this
 * card sets `kickerTarget` without a `kickerEffect` — the engine falls back to the printed
 * `spellEffect` when no kicked variant is defined. That works because the effect reads
 * [CardSource.ChosenTargets], which enumerates however many targets were actually announced. The
 * shape is Divine Resilience's (FDN), minus the second effect.
 *
 * "Creature you **own**" is ownership, not control ([ControllerPredicate.OwnedByYou]): a creature of
 * yours that an opponent has stolen is a legal target, and returning it puts it in *your* hand,
 * since a card always returns to its owner's hand.
 *
 * The token count is `moveTracked`'s record of what actually reached the hand, not the announced
 * target list — a target that became illegal is removed on resolution and must not be counted.
 * [DynamicAmount.DistinctEntitiesInCollections] counts entity ids without looking them up in state,
 * which is what makes the card's ruling work: a *token* creature returned to hand is counted even
 * though it ceases to exist (CR 111.7) before the delayed trigger fires.
 *
 * That count has to be frozen when the spell resolves, because the pipeline holding the collection
 * is gone by the next upkeep — `CreateDelayedTriggerExecutor` does that for the pipeline-scoped
 * amounts it finds in a scheduled `CreateTokenEffect`.
 *
 * "The **next** upkeep" is any player's, not specifically yours, so the delayed trigger carries no
 * `fireOnPlayer` and uses [DelayedTriggerTiming.CURRENT_TURN_OR_LATER] — the next upkeep step to
 * begin, which on your own turn is your opponent's.
