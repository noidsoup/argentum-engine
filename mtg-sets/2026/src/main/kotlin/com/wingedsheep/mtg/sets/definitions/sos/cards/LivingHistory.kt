/**
 * Living History
 * {1}{R}
 * Enchantment
 *
 * When this enchantment enters, create a 2/2 red and white Spirit creature token.
 * Whenever you attack, if a card left your graveyard this turn, target attacking creature
 * gets +2/+0 until end of turn.
 *
 * The ETB is a straightforward token-maker. The attack ability is an intervening-"if"
 * triggered ability (Rule 603.4): [Conditions.CardsLeftGraveyardThisTurn] is checked both
 * when the trigger would fire and again on resolution, gating the +2/+0 buff on a card
 * having left the controller's graveyard earlier in the turn.
