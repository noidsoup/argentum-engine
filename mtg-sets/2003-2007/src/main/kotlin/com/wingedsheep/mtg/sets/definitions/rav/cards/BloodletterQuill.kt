/**
 * Bloodletter Quill — Ravnica: City of Guilds #254
 * {3} · Artifact · Rare
 *
 * {2}, {T}, Put a blood counter on this artifact: Draw a card, then you lose 1 life for each blood
 * counter on this artifact.
 * {U}{B}: Remove a blood counter from this artifact.
 *
 * A repeatable draw whose price is its own history: every card costs one more life than the last,
 * and the Dimir half of the card buys that history back down a counter at a time.
 *
 * **The counter is an activation cost, not part of the effect.** [Costs.PutCounterOnSelf] is the
 * accruing cost atom (Mazemind Tome's shape) — it is paid on activation, before the ability is even
 * on the stack, and it is always payable since it takes nothing away. That ordering is what the
 * card's own ruling turns on: the counter is already there when the ability resolves, so the very
 * first activation costs a life, and an opponent (or you) may respond to the activation by removing
 * that counter with the second ability before the life is counted.
 *
 * **The life loss is read at resolution, not at activation.** [DynamicAmounts.countersOnSelf] over
 * [Counters.BLOOD] resolves against the Quill's counters at the moment the draw resolves — which is
 * exactly what makes the response window in that ruling meaningful.
 *
 * **The second ability removes the counter as its *effect*, not as a cost.** Its printed cost is
 * only {U}{B}; "Remove a blood counter from this artifact" is what it does on resolution. Wiring
 * the removal as a cost would make it unactivatable with no counters on the Quill — harmless in
 * practice, but wrong, and it would also let the removal happen before the mana was even paid.
 *
 * The blood counter ([Counters.BLOOD]) is a passive storage counter with no inherent rule; the
 * card's own two abilities are the only things that write and read it. It is unrelated to the
 * Innistrad Blood *token*.
