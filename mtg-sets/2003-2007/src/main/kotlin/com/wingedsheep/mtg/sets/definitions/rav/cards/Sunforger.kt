/**
 * Sunforger — Ravnica: City of Guilds #272
 * {3} · Artifact — Equipment · Rare
 *
 * Equipped creature gets +4/+0.
 * {R}{W}, Unattach this Equipment: Search your library for a red or white instant card with mana
 * value 4 or less and cast that card without paying its mana cost. Then shuffle.
 * Equip {3}
 *
 * Modelling notes:
 * - **New SDK vocabulary: `CostAtom.Unattach`** (`Costs.Unattach`). The *effect*
 *   `UnattachEquipmentEffect` already existed for "unattach it" riders; the *cost* did not, and it
 *   is not a lookalike of any existing atom — a sacrifice moves zones, a tap can be restored, and
 *   this does neither. Its affordability gate is the card's own 2020-08-07 ruling: "You can't pay
 *   the cost of unattaching Sunforger unless Sunforger is attached to a creature", so the ability
 *   is not even offered while it sits unattached. Payment runs through the same
 *   `ZoneMovementUtils.unattachEmittingEvent` chokepoint as the effect, so a "becomes unattached"
 *   trigger cannot tell the two apart.
 * - The activated ability is at **instant speed** — the whole point of the card, and what
 *   `activatedAbility` gives by default. Unattaching mid-combat is legal and is how the card is
 *   played; nothing about the cost implies the sorcery timing that `equipAbility` carries.
 * - The search is the ordinary Gather → Select → cast pipeline rather than
 *   `Patterns.Library.searchLibrary`, because that helper's `SearchDestination` vocabulary has no
 *   "cast it" case — hand / battlefield / graveyard / top of library are all it can reach.
 *   `ChooseUpTo(1)` rather than `ChooseExactly(1)` is the "search … and cast" reading every such
 *   card gets: a search may always fail to find (CR 701.19c).
 * - **Shuffle before the cast, not after.** The printed order is "cast that card … Then shuffle",
 *   but the two are order-independent here: the found card is already held in a pipeline
 *   collection, and `CastFromCollectionWithoutPayingCost` re-finds its current zone, so shuffling
 *   with it still in the library and then pulling it out reaches the same state as the reverse.
 *   Doing it in this order keeps the shuffle from having to survive the pause the cast opens for
 *   the spell's own targets. `Patterns.Library.searchLibrary` takes the same liberty for its
 *   top-of-library destination.
 * - Casting "without paying its mana cost" carries the printed rulings for free: no alternative
 *   costs, mandatory additional costs still owed, and X = 0 — all of them properties of
 *   [CastFromCollectionWithoutPayingCostEffect] rather than of this card.
