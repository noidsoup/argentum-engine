/**
 * Profane Command
 * {X}{B}{B}
 * Sorcery
 * Choose two —
 * • Target player loses X life.
 * • Return target creature card with mana value X or less from your graveyard to the battlefield.
 * • Target creature gets -X/-X until end of turn.
 * • Up to X target creatures gain fear until end of turn.
 *
 * The black member of the Lorwyn Command cycle, and the only one with an {X} in its cost. The
 * 2007-10-01 ruling — "the value chosen for X applies to each X in the spell's effect. You pay {X}
 * only once" — is exactly what falls out of every mode reading the *same* [DynamicAmount.XValue]:
 * both chosen modes see the one X paid at cast time.
 *
 * X appears in three different grammatical positions, and each needs its own SDK spelling:
 *  - as an **amount** (`LoseLife`) — [DynamicAmount.XValue] straight.
 *  - as a **filter bound** ("mana value X or less") — `manaValueAtMostX()`, a card predicate that
 *    reads the paid X, not a fixed number baked in at authoring time.
 *  - as a **target count** ("up to X target creatures") — `dynamicMaxCount = XValue` with
 *    `optional = true` for the "up to", the shape Word of Binding and Icy Blast use.
 *
 * The -X/-X mode negates through [DynamicAmount.Multiply] rather than a separate "negative amount"
 * type, matching Chill Haunting.
