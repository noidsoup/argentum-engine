/**
 * Plague Boiler — Ravnica: City of Guilds #269
 * {3} · Artifact · Rare
 *
 * At the beginning of your upkeep, put a plague counter on this artifact.
 * {1}{B}{G}: Put a plague counter on this artifact or remove a plague counter from it.
 * When this artifact has three or more plague counters on it, sacrifice it. If you do, destroy all
 * nonland permanents.
 *
 * A three-turn fuse anyone can hurry along and only its controller can hold back — the middle
 * ability is the whole card, letting you spend {1}{B}{G} to detonate a turn early or to keep the
 * board alive one more turn.
 *
 * **The middle ability is a resolution-time choice, not a cast-time modal.** The printed text has
 * no "Choose one —" bulleted list, so under CR 700.2 it is not a modal spell/ability at all: the
 * player picks add-or-remove *as it resolves*, which is what the card's first ruling says. That
 * maps onto [ModalEffect.chooseOne] on an *activated* ability, whose modes the `ModalEffectExecutor`
 * presents at resolution rather than at activation.
 *
 * **The third ability is genuinely state-triggered** (CR 603.8) and not a state-based action: it
 * fires on the false → true transition of "three or more plague counters", goes on the stack, and
 * does its work on resolution. Both halves of that matter for the second ruling — removing a
 * counter in response does *not* stop the sacrifice (the condition is not rechecked on resolution),
 * but getting the Boiler off the battlefield does, because there is then nothing to sacrifice and
 * [IfYouDoEffect] gates the wipe on the sacrifice actually happening.
 *
 * The plague counter ([Counters.PLAGUE]) is a passive storage counter with no inherent rule.
 *
 * One deliberate simplification: with no plague counters on the Boiler, the "remove" mode is still
 * offered and simply does nothing, where the printed card would not let you choose it. Nothing
 * downstream reads the choice, so the two differ only in which dead button the UI shows.
