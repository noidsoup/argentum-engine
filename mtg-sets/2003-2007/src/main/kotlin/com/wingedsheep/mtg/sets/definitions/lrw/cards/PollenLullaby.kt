/**
 * Pollen Lullaby
 * {1}{W}
 * Instant
 *
 * Prevent all combat damage that would be dealt this turn. Clash with an opponent. If you win,
 * creatures that player controls don't untap during the player's next untap step.
 *
 * The fog resolves unconditionally and first — a lost clash still prevents the damage — so it sits
 * ahead of [Patterns.Mechanic.clash] rather than on either of its legs.
 *
 * "That player" is the *clash* opponent, not a target: the card chooses nobody, and
 * [Patterns.Mechanic.clash] writes the chosen opponent into the source's durable `OPPONENT` slot,
 * which [Player.ChosenOpponent] reads back. Using the chosen slot rather than a fresh
 * `Chooser.Opponent` is what keeps a multiplayer clash from freezing a player who never clashed.
 * `affectsLands = false` because the printed clause names creatures only — the Exhaustion/Blinding
 * Beam axis on [SkipUntapEffect], not a narrower effect.
