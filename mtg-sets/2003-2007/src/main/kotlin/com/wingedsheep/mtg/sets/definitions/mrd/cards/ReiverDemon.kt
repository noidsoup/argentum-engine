/**
 * Reiver Demon — Mirrodin #75
 * {4}{B}{B}{B}{B} · Creature — Demon · 6/6 · Rare
 *
 * Flying
 * When this creature enters, if you cast it from your hand, destroy all nonartifact, nonblack
 * creatures. They can't be regenerated.
 *
 * The intervening-if is [Conditions.WasCastFromHand] on the enters trigger (CR 603.4) — the same
 * cast-origin marker Phage the Untouchable reads with the negated form. Reanimating or blinking the
 * Demon gets a 6/6 flier and no wipe.
 *
 * The wipe itself is [Effects.DestroyAll] over `Creature.nonartifact().notColor(BLACK)` with
 * `noRegenerate = true` for "they can't be regenerated" (functional errata of the printed "bury").
 * Reiver Demon is black, so it is outside its own filter and never needs an explicit self-exclusion;
 * an artifact creature or another black creature survives too.
