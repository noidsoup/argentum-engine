/**
 * Clockwork Dragon — Mirrodin #155
 * {7} · Artifact Creature — Dragon · 0/0 · Rare
 *
 * Flying
 * This creature enters with six +1/+1 counters on it.
 * Whenever this creature attacks or blocks, remove a +1/+1 counter from it at end of combat.
 * {3}: Put a +1/+1 counter on this creature.
 *
 * The top of the Mirrodin Clockwork ladder, and modelled exactly like its setmates Clockwork Beetle
 * and Clockwork Condor (and their Antiquities ancestor Clockwork Avian): printed 0/0 plus six
 * [EntersWithCounters] +1/+1 counters (CR 613.4c, layer 7d) make a 6/6 on the battlefield, and it
 * dies as a state-based action once the last counter is shed.
 *
 * The counter-shed line is a trigger that *sets up a delayed trigger* ("…remove a counter from it at
 * end of combat"). [Triggers.EachEndOfCombat] with the intervening-if
 * [Conditions.SourceAttackedOrBlockedThisCombat] is observationally identical — one counter shed per
 * combat the Dragon fought in, on any player's turn — because the delayed trigger and the tracker
 * are keyed to the same object and both go away when it leaves the battlefield.
 *
 * Unlike Clockwork Avian, the recharge ability carries **no** timing or ceiling restriction: it is a
 * plain `{3}` activation usable any time the Dragon's controller has priority, and it can push the
 * Dragon above six counters.
