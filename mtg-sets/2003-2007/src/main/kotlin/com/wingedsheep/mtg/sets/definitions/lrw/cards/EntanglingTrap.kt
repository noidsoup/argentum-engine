/**
 * Entangling Trap
 * {1}{W}
 * Enchantment
 * Whenever you clash, tap target creature an opponent controls. If you won, that creature doesn't
 * untap during its controller's next untap step. (This ability triggers after the clash ends.)
 *
 * The clash *payoff* that acts either way — the sibling of Sylvan Echoes, which only acts on a win.
 * The tap is unconditional, so the trigger is [Triggers.WheneverYouClash] and the win rides inside
 * the effect as [Conditions.YouWonTheClash] rather than on the trigger: losing still puts the
 * ability on the stack and still taps a creature. Per its ruling that also holds when an opponent's
 * spell started the clash — you clashed, so it triggers, and you can still have won.
 *
 * Both halves address the same target slot, which is what makes the printed
 * "that creature" one creature rather than two: a second trigger gated on winning would re-target.
 * The freeze is the Crippling Chill shape — [AbilityFlag.DOESNT_UNTAP] for
 * [Duration.UntilAfterAffectedControllersNextUntap], which expires with that one untap step rather
 * than at end of turn.
