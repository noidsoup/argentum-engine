/**
 * Oblivion Ring
 * {2}{W}
 * Enchantment
 * When this enchantment enters, exile another target nonland permanent.
 * When this enchantment leaves the battlefield, return the exiled card to the battlefield under its
 * owner's control.
 *
 * Two *separate* triggers, not one "exile until ~ leaves" — that's the whole point of the 2007-10-01
 * ruling: if the Ring leaves before its ETB trigger resolves, the leaves trigger fires first and
 * finds nothing, and the ETB then exiles its target permanently. Modelling this as `ExileUntilLeaves`
 * plus a linked return (rather than a duration-scoped exile) keeps that ordering honest.
 *
 * "another target nonland permanent" is [TargetFilter.OtherNonlandPermanent] — any controller's, but
 * never the Ring itself.
