/**
 * Faith's Fetters
 * {3}{W}
 * Enchantment — Aura
 *
 * Enchant permanent
 * When this Aura enters, you gain 4 life.
 * Enchanted permanent can't attack or block, and its activated abilities can't be activated
 * unless they're mana abilities.
 *
 * Arrest's three-static shape widened one step in each direction: it enchants any *permanent*
 * rather than a creature, and the activation lock spares mana abilities. Both are expressible
 * as-is — [GroupFilter.attachedCreature] is scope-based (`GameObjectFilter.Permanent` scoped to
 * the attachment) despite the name, so it already covers a non-creature host, and
 * [PreventActivatedAbilities] carries the `nonManaAbilitiesOnly` flag for the
 * "… unless they're mana abilities" wording.
 *
 * The combat halves are inert on a non-creature host rather than wrong: a Fettered land was
 * never going to attack or block, and if it later animates the statics are already on it.
