/**
 * Lignify
 * {1}{G}
 * Kindred Enchantment — Treefolk Aura
 *
 * Enchant creature
 * Enchanted creature is a Treefolk with base power and toughness 0/4 and loses all abilities.
 *
 * Three layered statics over the enchanted creature, matching the printed clause order:
 *  - [TransformPermanent] with only `setSubtypes` — Layer 4 `SetAllSubtypes` **replaces** every
 *    creature type with Treefolk (the 2007-10-01 ruling: it overwrites earlier type-changing
 *    effects, changeling included). `setCardTypes` is left empty on purpose so the card types are
 *    untouched — "is a Treefolk" changes only the creature type, so an artifact creature stays an
 *    artifact. Colors and name are untouched for the same reason.
 *  - [LoseAllAbilities] — Layer 6.
 *  - [SetBasePowerToughnessStatic] 0/4 — Layer 7b, so it overwrites a CDA (the ruling names
 *    Dauntless Dourbark) but loses to later +N/+N effects and counters, which apply in 7c/7d.
 *
 * Originally printed as a Tribal enchantment; "Tribal" was errata'd to "Kindred" in 2024 with no
 * gameplay change (2024-06-07 ruling).
