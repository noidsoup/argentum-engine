/**
 * Glimmervoid — Mirrodin #281
 * Land
 *
 * At the beginning of the end step, if you control no artifacts, sacrifice this land.
 * {T}: Add one mana of any color.
 *
 * A five-color land with an artifact-shaped leash, composed from two existing primitives.
 *
 * The mana half is [Effects.AddAnyColorMana] (one mana, one chosen color), marked
 * `manaAbility = true` with [TimingRule.ManaAbility] so it never uses the stack (CR 605.1a).
 *
 * The upkeep-of-the-drawback half is [Triggers.EachEndStep] — *each* end step, not just yours, so
 * an opponent's turn kills it just as fast — with the "if you control no artifacts" clause as an
 * intervening-if [interveningIf]. That matters twice (CR 603.4): the ability doesn't even
 * trigger while you control an artifact, and if the last artifact leaves in response to the
 * trigger, the sacrifice still happens; conversely, deploying an artifact in response to the
 * trigger saves the land.
 *
 * Color identity stays colorless — "any color" adds nothing to identity (CR 903.4).
