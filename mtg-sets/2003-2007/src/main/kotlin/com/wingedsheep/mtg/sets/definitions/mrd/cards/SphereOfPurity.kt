/**
 * Sphere of Purity — Mirrodin #26
 * {3}{W} · Enchantment · Common
 *
 * If an artifact would deal damage to you, prevent 1 of that damage.
 *
 * Modelling notes:
 * - A continuous [PreventDamage] replacement (CR 615) rather than a shield effect: it applies to
 *   every instance for as long as the Sphere is on the battlefield, and there is nothing to
 *   "use up". `amount = 1` is a *partial* prevention — a Triskelion ping is fully stopped, an
 *   Arcbound Ravager swing for 4 still deals 3.
 * - Recipient is [RecipientFilter.You], i.e. the Sphere's controller only; it does nothing for
 *   your creatures or planeswalkers, and nothing for your teammates.
 * - The source filter is `GameObjectFilter.Artifact`, not artifact *creature* — the damage
 *   source only has to be an artifact, so an artifact creature attacking you is covered too.
 *   Same shape as Artifact Ward's clause, with the recipient moved from the enchanted creature
 *   to the controller and the amount capped at 1.
