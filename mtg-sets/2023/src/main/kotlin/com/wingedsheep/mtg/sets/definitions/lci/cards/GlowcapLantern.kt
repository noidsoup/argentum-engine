/**
 * Glowcap Lantern (LCI #187) — {G} Artifact — Equipment (uncommon)
 *
 * Equipped creature has "You may look at the top card of your library any time" and
 * "Whenever this creature attacks, it explores."
 * Equip {2}
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 * - "Whenever this creature attacks, it explores" is granted to the equipped creature via
 *   [GrantTriggeredAbility] + [Triggers.attacks] (SELF binding). The [Effects.Explore] targets
 *   [EffectTarget.Self] — the granted ability's source, i.e. the equipped creature — so "it"
 *   explores and any +1/+1 counter lands on that creature.
 * - "You may look at the top card of your library any time" is the filterless player-permission
 *   static [LookAtTopOfLibrary], which grants its controller the private peek. It lives on the
 *   Equipment (there is no primitive to scope a filterless player static onto the equipped
 *   creature) but is gated on the Equipment being attached — a conditional static whose
 *   condition is [Conditions.SourceMatches] "attached to a creature" — so an *unattached*
 *   Glowcap Lantern grants no peek, matching the printed card (the permission only exists while
 *   attached, as part of "Equipped creature has ...").
