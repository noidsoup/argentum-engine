/**
 * Broodrage Mycoid
 * {3}{B}
 * Creature — Fungus
 * 4/3
 *
 * At the beginning of your end step, if you descended this turn, create a 1/1 black
 * Fungus creature token with "This token can't block."
 * (You descended if a permanent card was put into your graveyard from anywhere.)
 *
 * "Descended this turn" is CR 700.11: at least one nontoken permanent card was put into
 * your graveyard from any zone this turn. The intervening-if gate fires only once per end
 * step regardless of how many times you descended, and cannot trigger if you have not yet
 * descended as the end step begins.
 *
 * The token's "This token can't block" is a static ability on the token itself, modelled
 * as [CantBlock] with [GroupFilter.source()] — identical to the decayed keyword's
 * cant-block component and to Kavu Aggressor's printed restriction.
