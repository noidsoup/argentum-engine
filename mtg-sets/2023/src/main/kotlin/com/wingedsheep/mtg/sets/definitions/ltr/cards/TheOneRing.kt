/**
 * The One Ring
 * {4}
 * Legendary Artifact
 *
 * Indestructible
 * When The One Ring enters, if you cast it, you gain protection from everything until your next turn.
 * At the beginning of your upkeep, you lose 1 life for each burden counter on The One Ring.
 * {T}: Put a burden counter on The One Ring, then draw a card for each burden counter on The One Ring.
 *
 * Engine notes (Gap 8 — player-level protection):
 * - "You gain protection from everything until your next turn" is the player counterpart of the
 *   creature protection statics. Modeled via `Effects.GrantPlayerProtection()` (defaults to
 *   ProtectionScope.Everything / Duration.UntilYourNextTurn / the controller). While protected the
 *   controller can't be targeted by, or dealt damage from, any source (CR 702.16), until cleared
 *   after the untap step of their next turn.
 * - The ETB is gated on `Conditions.WasCast` ("if you cast it") — putting The One Ring onto the
 *   battlefield by another effect grants no protection (CR 603.4 intervening-if).
 * - The {T} ability adds the burden counter first, then draws reading the *new* count (sequential
 *   resolution, CR 608.2c): `AddCounters` then `DrawCards(countersOnSelf(burden))`.
 * - The burden counter has no rules meaning of its own; it only feeds the upkeep life-loss and the
 *   draw count, and grows the upkeep tax each activation.
