/**
 * Tattered Ratter
 * {1}{R}
 * Creature — Human Peasant
 * 2/2
 *
 * Whenever a Rat you control becomes blocked, it gets +2/+0 until end of turn.
 *
 * The Berserk Murlodont shape: an ANY-bound `becomesBlocked` watching every Rat *you control*
 * (not just this creature), with the pump applied to [EffectTarget.TriggeringEntity] — the Rat
 * that got blocked, which may well not be the Ratter. Untargeted, so a hexproof Rat is still
 * pumped. The trigger fires once per Rat that becomes blocked, and once only per combat for that
 * Rat regardless of how many creatures block it (CR 509.1h) — the +2/+0 doesn't scale with the
 * number of blockers.
