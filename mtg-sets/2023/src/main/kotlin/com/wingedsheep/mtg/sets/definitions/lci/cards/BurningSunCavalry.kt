/**
 * Burning Sun Cavalry
 * {1}{R}
 * Creature — Human Knight
 * 2/2
 * Whenever this creature attacks or blocks while you control a Dinosaur, this creature gets
 * +1/+1 until end of turn.
 *
 * "while you control a Dinosaur" is a trigger-time condition, NOT an intervening-if clause
 * (CR 603.4 applies only to an "if" immediately following the trigger event). Whether you control
 * a Dinosaur is checked only as this creature attacks or blocks; once the ability has triggered it
 * still resolves even if the Dinosaur later leaves. The engine's `triggerRestriction` is evaluated at
 * trigger detection and not re-checked on resolution, which matches this "while" semantics.
