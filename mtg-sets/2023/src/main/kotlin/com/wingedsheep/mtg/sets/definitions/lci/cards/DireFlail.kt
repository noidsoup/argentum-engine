/**
 * Dire Flail // Dire Blunderbuss (CR 702.167, The Lost Caverns of Ixalan, #145)
 * {R}
 * Artifact — Equipment // Artifact — Equipment
 *
 * Front face — Dire Flail ({R}, Artifact — Equipment)
 *   Equipped creature gets +2/+0.
 *   Equip {1}
 *   Craft with artifact {3}{R}{R} ({3}{R}{R}, Exile this artifact, Exile another artifact
 *   you control or an artifact card from your graveyard: Return this card transformed
 *   under its owner's control. Craft only as a sorcery.)
 *
 * Back face — Dire Blunderbuss (Artifact — Equipment)
 *   Equipped creature gets +3/+0 and has "Whenever this creature attacks, you may
 *   sacrifice an artifact other than Dire Blunderbuss. When you do, this creature deals
 *   damage equal to its power to target creature."
 *   Equip {1}
 *
 * Implementation:
 *  - Front: [ModifyStats] +2/+0 static scoped to [Filters.EquippedCreature] plus the
 *    canonical `equipAbility("{1}")` (sorcery-speed attach, CR 702.6). The craft line uses
 *    the `craft(...)` helper with [GameObjectFilter.Artifact] and `minCount = maxCount = 1`
 *    ("Craft with artifact" = exactly one artifact material, CR 702.167a-b); resolution
 *    returns this card transformed under its owner's control. Unlike Sovereign's
 *    Macuahuitl, the back face has no ETB attach trigger — it enters unattached.
 *  - Back: [ModifyStats] +3/+0 static, and the quoted attack ability is granted to the
 *    equipped creature via [GrantTriggeredAbility] + [Triggers.attacks] (SELF binding, the
 *    Pirate Hat idiom), so it lives on the creature and fires when that creature attacks.
 *    The ability body is a [ReflexiveTriggerEffect] (the Glorifier of Suffering /
 *    Thousand Moons Crackshot idiom): the optional action selects an artifact you control
 *    other than the granting Equipment and sacrifices it; only "when you do" does the
 *    reflexive part go on the stack, choose target creature, and deal damage equal to the
 *    equipped creature's power ([DynamicAmounts.sourcePower] — the granted ability's source
 *    is the equipped creature; the damage source defaults to it, matching "this creature deals").
 *
 * "an artifact other than Dire Blunderbuss" — CR 201.5a: the name refers only to the specific
 * granting Equipment. The engine threads the granting permanent through granted *triggered*
 * abilities (`PendingTrigger.granterId` → `TriggeredAbilityOnStackComponent.granterId` →
 * `EffectContext.granterId` → `PredicateContext.granterId`), so the exclusion is the entity-based
 * `.notGrantingPermanent()`: it excludes *exactly* this granting Blunderbuss and nothing else — a
 * second Dire Blunderbuss elsewhere and any other Equipment attached to the same creature all stay
 * sacrificable, matching the printed card in every case.
