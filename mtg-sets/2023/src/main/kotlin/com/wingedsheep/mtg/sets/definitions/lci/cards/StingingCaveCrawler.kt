/**
 * Stinging Cave Crawler — {2}{B}
 * Creature — Insect Horror
 * 1/3
 *
 * Deathtouch
 * Descend 4 — Whenever this creature attacks, if there are four or more permanent cards in your
 * graveyard, you draw a card and you lose 1 life.
 *
 * The "Descend 4" ability word has no rules meaning of its own (CR 207.2c) — it is purely
 * reminder framing for the intervening-if condition (four or more permanent cards in your
 * graveyard, CR 603.4). Modeled as an attack trigger with
 * an intervening-if [Conditions.CardsInGraveyardMatchingAtLeast]: the ability triggers on attack
 * only when the condition already holds, and it is rechecked at resolution — if the graveyard count
 * drops below four before it resolves, the ability is removed from the stack without effect.
 *
 * On resolution the controller draws a card and loses 1 life (both mandatory, no choice), so the
 * effect is a composite of [Effects.DrawCards] on the controller and [Effects.LoseLife] targeting
 * the controller.
