/**
 * Malamet Veteran — {4}{G}
 * Creature — Cat Warrior
 * 5/4
 *
 * Trample
 * Descend 4 — Whenever this creature attacks, if there are four or more permanent cards in your
 * graveyard, put a +1/+1 counter on target creature.
 *
 * "Descend 4" is an ability word (CR 207.2c — no rules meaning of its own); the rules content is
 * the intervening-if clause (CR 603.4): four or more permanent cards in your graveyard. Modeled as
 * an attack trigger with an intervening-if [Conditions.CardsInGraveyardMatchingAtLeast]: the
 * ability goes on the stack only when the condition holds at trigger time. Known engine gap: CR
 * 603.4 also requires the condition to be rechecked as the ability resolves, but the engine
 * evaluates `interveningIf` only at detection time (`TriggerMatcher.filterByTriggerCondition`),
 * so a graveyard emptied in response still resolves the trigger.
 *
 * Targeting is mandatory (no "may"): the controller must choose any creature (theirs or an
 * opponent's) to receive the +1/+1 counter. If no legal target exists the ability doesn't go on the
 * stack; if the sole target becomes illegal before resolution the ability fizzles.
