/**
 * Huatli, Poet of Unity // Roar of the Fifth People — The Lost Caverns of Ixalan #189
 * {2}{G} · Legendary Creature — Human Warrior Bard 2/3
 * //  · Enchantment — Saga
 *
 * Front — Huatli, Poet of Unity:
 *   When Huatli enters, search your library for a basic land card, reveal it, put it into your
 *   hand, then shuffle.
 *   {3}{R/W}{R/W}: Exile Huatli, then return her to the battlefield transformed under her owner's
 *   control. Activate only as a sorcery.
 *
 * Back — Roar of the Fifth People (Saga):
 *   (As this Saga enters and after your draw step, add a lore counter.)
 *   I   — Create two 3/3 green Dinosaur creature tokens.
 *   II  — This Saga gains "Creatures you control have '{T}: Add {R}, {G}, or {W}.'"
 *   III — Search your library for a Dinosaur card, reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle.
 *   IV  — Dinosaurs you control gain double strike and trample until end of turn.
 *
 * Transform loop mirrors Dion, Bahamut's Dominant / Terra, Magical Adept: the sorcery-speed
 * activated ability exile-returns Huatli transformed, so Roar re-enters the battlefield as a Saga
 * and picks up CR 714.3a's on-enter lore counter (chapter I triggers) via the shared Saga-entry
 * hook — no explicit lore-counter effect is needed. The back is a non-creature enchantment, so the
 * DFC is assembled with [CardDefinition.doubleFacedPermanent] rather than `doubleFacedCreature`.
 *
 * Chapter II grants Roar itself a lasting static ability (Duration.Permanent — it ends when Roar
 * leaves, i.e. the CR 714.4 final-chapter sacrifice), and that static is the Citanul Hierophants
 * "creatures you control have '{T}: Add …'" shape: a [GrantActivatedAbility] handing every creature
 * you control a `{T}` mana ability that produces one mana chosen from {R}/{G}/{W}
 * ([ManaColorSet.Specific]).
