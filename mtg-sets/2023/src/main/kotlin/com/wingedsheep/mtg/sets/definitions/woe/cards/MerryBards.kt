 * 3/2
 *
 * When this creature enters, you may pay {1}. When you do, create a Young Hero Role token attached
 * to target creature you control. (If you control another Role on it, put that one into the
 * graveyard. Enchanted creature has "Whenever this creature attacks, if its toughness is 3 or less,
 * put a +1/+1 counter on it.")
 *
 * Same reflexive "you may pay {1}. When you do" shape as Spellbook Vendor — the target for the Role
 * token isn't chosen when the ETB triggers, but when the reflexive ability goes on the stack after
 * the {1} is paid. The Young Hero Role token carries the granted attack trigger.
