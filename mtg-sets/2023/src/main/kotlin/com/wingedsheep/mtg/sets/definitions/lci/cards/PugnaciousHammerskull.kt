/**
 * Pugnacious Hammerskull
 * {2}{G}
 * Creature — Dinosaur
 * 6/6
 * Whenever this creature attacks while you don't control another Dinosaur, put a stun counter on
 * it. (If a permanent with a stun counter would become untapped, remove one from it instead.)
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 * - `Triggers.Attacks` fires per AttackEvent for the creature itself (SELF binding).
 * - The intervening-if (CR 603.4) is the negated, self-excluding control check
 *   `Conditions.YouControl(Creature Dinosaur, negate = true, excludeSelf = true)`:
 *   "you don't control another Dinosaur" — the Hammerskull itself is excluded from the search,
 *   and `negate` inverts the existence test. Checked both when the trigger would go on the stack
 *   and again on resolution; if either check finds another Dinosaur, the trigger doesn't fire (or
 *   is removed before resolving).
 * - `Effects.AddCounters(Counters.STUN, 1, EffectTarget.Self)` places one stun counter on the
 *   Hammerskull, keeping it from untapping (CR 122.1d / stun counter replacement).
