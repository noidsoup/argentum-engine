/**
 * Stalactite Stalker — {B}
 * Creature — Goblin Rogue
 * 1/1
 *
 * Menace
 * At the beginning of your end step, if you descended this turn, put a +1/+1 counter on this creature.
 * (You descended if a permanent card was put into your graveyard from anywhere.)
 * {2}{B}, Sacrifice this creature: Target creature gets -X/-X until end of turn, where X is this
 * creature's power.
 *
 * "Descended this turn" is CR 700.11 (intervening-if gated end-step trigger, once per end step;
 * won't trigger unless you've already descended when the step begins).
 *
 * The activated ability sacrifices Stalactite Stalker as a cost, then reads its power for X. Because
 * the source is gone by resolution, X is last-known information: `EntityProperty(Source, Power)`
 * resolves via the source's LKI snapshot captured at cost-payment time (CR 113.7a / 608.2h),
 * including any +1/+1 counters it had accrued. (`Source` — not `Sacrificed()` — is the correct
 * reference for a `SacrificeSelf` cost: the self-sacrifice target is implicit, so it never lands in
 * the payment's explicit sacrifice list that `Sacrificed()` reads, whereas the self-sac source
 * snapshot backing `Source` is always captured; this matches Ghitu Fire-Eater.) -X/-X is that amount
 * negated (`Multiply(..., -1)`).
