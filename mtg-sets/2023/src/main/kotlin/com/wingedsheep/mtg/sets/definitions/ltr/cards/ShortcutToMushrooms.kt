/**
 * Shortcut to Mushrooms
 * {1}{G}
 * Enchantment
 *
 * When this enchantment enters, the Ring tempts you.
 * At the beginning of your end step, if a permanent you controlled left the battlefield
 * this turn, put a +1/+1 counter on target creature you control.
 *
 * The end-step trigger is gated by `Conditions.YouHadPermanentLeaveBattlefieldThisTurn`
 * (LTR Gap 19) — a per-player tracker incremented by `ZoneTransitionService` whenever a
 * permanent you controlled left the battlefield this turn (creatures, lands, tokens,
 * anything), and cleared at end-of-turn cleanup.
 *
 * Intervening-if gating (Rule 603.4): the condition is evaluated both at trigger time
 * and at resolution. If the player loses their last creature between the trigger firing
 * and resolution, the trigger still resolves — the *permanent-left-battlefield* state is
 * a turn flag, not a board census.
