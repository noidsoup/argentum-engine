/**
 * Unstable Glyphbridge // Sandswirl Wanderglyph (CR 702.167, The Lost Caverns of Ixalan)
 * {3}{W}{W}
 * Artifact // Artifact Creature — Golem
 *
 * Front face — Unstable Glyphbridge ({3}{W}{W}, Artifact)
 *   When this artifact enters, if you cast it, for each player, choose a creature with power
 *   2 or less that player controls. Then destroy all creatures except creatures chosen this way.
 *   Craft with artifact {3}{W}{W}
 *
 * Back face — Sandswirl Wanderglyph (Artifact Creature — Golem, 5/3)
 *   Flying
 *   Whenever an opponent casts a spell during their turn, they can't attack you or
 *   planeswalkers you control this turn.
 *   Each opponent who attacked you or a planeswalker you control this turn can't cast spells.
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 *  - **ETB wipe** — the Winnowing shape: [ForEachPlayerEffect] (active player first) gathers each
 *    player's creatures, [Chooser.SourceController] lets the ability's controller pick the survivor
 *    (per the card's ruling, *you* choose for each player), with the selection filtered to power 2
 *    or less (evaluated against projected state). The unchosen remainder is destroyed via
 *    [MoveType.Destroy] inside the same iteration. A player with no power-≤2 creature gets no
 *    survivor (auto-selects nothing, everything is destroyed). Like Winnowing, the choose+destroy
 *    is interleaved per player rather than "all choices, then one simultaneous destruction" —
 *    identical outcomes except for exotic cross-player P/T dependencies mid-resolution and
 *    dies-trigger batching.
 *  - **"if you cast it"** — [Conditions.WasCast] as the trigger's intervening-if: false whenever
 *    the permanent was put onto the battlefield without being cast, which is exactly the craft
 *    return (and any reanimation/blink), so the wipe only fires on a cast.
 *  - **Craft with artifact {3}{W}{W}** — exact-count craft (`minCount = 1, maxCount = 1`) via the
 *    `craft(...)` helper; returns transformed as Sandswirl Wanderglyph.
 *  - **Back trigger** — [Triggers.OpponentCastsSpell] gated on [Conditions.IsNotYourTurn]
 *    ("during their turn"; exact in two-player games). The one-shot effect is a floating
 *    until-end-of-turn [Effects.CantAttackGroup] over creatures the *active player* controls:
 *    for the remainder of that turn the triggering opponent is the active player, and only the
 *    active player's creatures can be declared as attackers, so this is "that player can't attack"
 *    — which in a two-player game is precisely "can't attack you or planeswalkers you control".
 *    (In multiplayer, both the gate and the restriction would over-approximate; the engine's
 *    scenario coverage is two-player.) Rule 611.2c dynamics come free: a creature they cast later
 *    that turn (e.g. with haste) is also restricted.
 *  - **Back static** — [PlayersCantCastSpells] scoped to opponents, conditioned on
 *    [Conditions.PlayerAttackedPlayerThisTurn] (attacker = [Player.AnOpponent], defender = you).
 *    The per-turn attacked-players record ("attacked [a player]", CR 508.6) already counts attacks
 *    on you *or a planeswalker you control* — the defending player of an attack on a planeswalker
 *    is that planeswalker's controller (CR 508.5).
 *    Exact in two-player games ("an opponent" = the only opponent, who is also the only candidate
 *    caster); a multiplayer-exact per-caster scoping would need the cast-legality check to bind
 *    the casting player into the condition context.
