/**
 * Zoyowa Lava-Tongue {B}{R}
 * Legendary Creature — Goblin Warlock
 * 2/2
 *
 * Deathtouch
 * At the beginning of your end step, if you descended this turn, each opponent may
 * discard a card or sacrifice a permanent of their choice. Zoyowa deals
 * 3 damage to each opponent who didn't.
 * (You descended if a permanent card was put into your graveyard from anywhere.)
 *
 * "Descended this turn" is CR 700.11: at least one nontoken permanent card was put into
 * your graveyard from any zone this turn. The intervening-if gate fires only once per end
 * step regardless of how many times you descended, and cannot trigger if you have not yet
 * descended as the end step begins (Child of the Volcano / Broodrage Mycoid template).
 *
 * The per-opponent punisher is modeled with the Rottenmouth Viper / Thornplate Intimidator
 * template: [ForEachPlayerEffect] over [Player.EachOpponent] rebinds the controller to each
 * opponent in turn, then a [ChooseActionEffect] lets that opponent pick "Discard a card",
 * "Sacrifice a permanent", or the do-nothing option "Take 3 damage". Because the discard /
 * sacrifice are a "may", the damage option always remains available; infeasible discard /
 * sacrifice options are auto-filtered, so an opponent with no cards and no permanents simply
 * takes the 3 damage — exactly "each opponent who didn't." The damage source is Zoyowa
 * itself ([EffectTarget.Self], unaffected by the per-player controller rebind).
