/**
 * Starving Revenant (LCI #123) — {2}{B}{B} Creature — Spirit Horror (rare), 4/4.
 *
 * When this creature enters, surveil 2. Then for each card you put on top of your library, you
 * draw a card and you lose 3 life.
 * Descend 8 — Whenever you draw a card, if there are eight or more permanent cards in your
 * graveyard, target opponent loses 1 life and you gain 1 life.
 *
 * ETB "surveil-then-draw-per-card-kept" — composed entirely from existing primitives:
 *  - [Effects.Surveil] (2) runs the sanctioned surveil macro, whose expanded pipeline stores the
 *    cards the controller keeps ON TOP under the pipeline collection `"toTop"` (the surveil
 *    remainder) and fires "whenever you surveil" triggers. The macro executes in the *same*
 *    [com.wingedsheep.engine.handlers.EffectContext], so `"toTop"` is visible to the sibling
 *    effects that follow it in this Composite (CompositeEffectExecutor threads storedCollections
 *    across children, including across the surveil selection pause).
 *  - The count of cards kept on top is read with [DynamicAmount.DistinctEntitiesInCollections]
 *    over `"toTop"`. `MoveCollection` never clears its source collection, so the value is still
 *    correct after those cards have been moved onto the library. That count drives both the draw
 *    (`draw that many`) and, via [DynamicAmount.Multiply] × 3, the life loss (`lose 3 per card`).
 *  - Keeping zero on top ⇒ count 0 ⇒ draw 0 and lose 0 (both no-op), matching the rules.
 *
 * The ETB draws feed the card's own descend trigger below: each drawn card that resolves while
 * eight-or-more permanent cards sit in the graveyard puts a drain on the stack.
 *
 * Descend 8 (draw drain) — a "whenever you draw a card" ([Triggers.YouDraw], fires once per card
 * drawn) triggered ability gated by an intervening-if ([TriggeredAbilityBuilder.interveningIf]
 * = [Conditions.CardsInGraveyardMatchingAtLeast] (8, [GameObjectFilter.Permanent])). Per CR 603.4
 * the condition is checked both when the ability would trigger and again on resolution, so it does
 * nothing if the graveyard drops below eight permanent cards in between. "target opponent loses 1
 * life" is a fixed [Effects.LoseLife] on the bound opponent target; "you gain 1 life" is a fixed
 * [Effects.GainLife] on the controller — two separate fixed amounts, not a drain.
