/**
 * Brazen Blademaster
 * {2}{R}
 * Creature — Orc Pirate
 * 2/3
 * Whenever this creature attacks while you control two or more artifacts,
 * it gets +2/+1 until end of turn.
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 * - `Triggers.Attacks` fires per AttackEvent for the creature itself (SELF binding).
 * - "while you control two or more artifacts" is a trigger-time condition, NOT an intervening-if
 *   clause (CR 603.4 applies only to an "if" immediately after the trigger event). It is checked
 *   as `Conditions.YouControlAtLeast(2, GameObjectFilter.Artifact)` only when the creature attacks;
 *   the engine's `triggerRestriction` is evaluated at trigger detection, not re-checked on resolution
 *   — which matches the "while" semantics.
 * - `Effects.ModifyStats(+2, +1, EffectTarget.Self)` applies the bonus; the default duration
 *   is EndOfTurn, so it expires in the cleanup step.
