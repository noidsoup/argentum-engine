/**
 * Dream Spoilers
 * {3}{B}
 * Creature — Faerie Warlock
 * 2/2
 *
 * Flying
 * Whenever you cast a spell during an opponent's turn, up to one target creature an opponent
 * controls gets -1/-1 until end of turn.
 *
 * "During an opponent's turn" is checked when the ability would trigger, so it rides on
 * `triggerRestriction` ([Conditions.IsNotYourTurn]) rather than gating the resolved effect —
 * only players take turns, so "not your turn" is exactly "an opponent's turn".
 * "Up to one target" is an optional target, so the ability still resolves (doing nothing)
 * when no creature is chosen or the chosen one has left.
