/**
 * Council of Echoes — {4}{U}{U}
 * Creature — Spirit Advisor
 * 4/4
 *
 * Flying
 * Descend 4 — When this creature enters, if there are four or more permanent cards in your
 * graveyard, return up to one target nonland permanent other than this creature to its owner's
 * hand.
 *
 * "Descend 4" is an ability word; the mechanic is an intervening-if triggered ability whose
 * condition (CR 603.4) checks that the controller has four or more permanent cards in their
 * graveyard at both the time the trigger would fire and at resolution. If the count drops
 * below four before resolution the ability fizzles.
 *
 * "Up to one" makes the single target requirement optional (minimum 0). If the controller
 * declines to choose any target the effect resolves as a no-op. The target must be a nonland
 * permanent other than the Council itself ([TargetOther] excludes the source).
