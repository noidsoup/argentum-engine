/**
 * Coati Scavenger — {2}{G}
 * Creature — Raccoon
 * 3/2
 *
 * Descend 4 — When this creature enters, if there are four or more permanent cards in your
 * graveyard, return target permanent card from your graveyard to your hand.
 *
 * "Descend 4" is an ability word (CR 207.2c) with no rules meaning of its own; it merely names the
 * intervening-if condition (four or more permanent cards in your graveyard). The trigger fires on ETB
 * only when the condition is already true at that moment and is rechecked at resolution — if the
 * graveyard count drops below four before resolution the ability fizzles without effect (no valid
 * target for the return effect in any case).
 *
 * Targeting is mandatory (no "may") — the controller must choose a permanent card from their
 * graveyard to return if at least one exists. If none exists, the ability fizzles.
