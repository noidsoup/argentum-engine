/**
 * Growing Rites of Itlimoc // Itlimoc, Cradle of the Sun (Ixalan — the card's earliest
 * printing; also reprinted in The Lost Caverns of Ixalan)
 * {2}{G}
 * Legendary Enchantment // Legendary Land
 *
 * Front — Growing Rites of Itlimoc (Legendary Enchantment, {2}{G})
 *   When Growing Rites of Itlimoc enters, look at the top four cards of your library. You may
 *   reveal a creature card from among them and put it into your hand. Put the rest on the
 *   bottom of your library in any order.
 *   At the beginning of your end step, if you control four or more creatures, transform
 *   Growing Rites of Itlimoc.
 *
 * Back — Itlimoc, Cradle of the Sun (Legendary Land)
 *   {T}: Add {G}.
 *   {T}: Add {G} for each creature you control.
 *
 * Implementation:
 *  - ETB uses [Patterns.Library.lookAtTopRevealMatchingToHand] (count 4, [GameObjectFilter.Creature],
 *    rest to the bottom in the controller's chosen order, [CardOrder.ControllerChooses]).
 *  - End-step transform is a [Triggers.YourEndStep] ability with an intervening-if
 *    [Conditions.YouControlAtLeast]`(4, Creature)` → [TransformEffect].
 *  - Back's scaling mana ability is [Effects.AddMana]`(GREEN, `[DynamicAmount.AggregateBattlefield]`)`,
 *    the Gaea's Cradle idiom.
