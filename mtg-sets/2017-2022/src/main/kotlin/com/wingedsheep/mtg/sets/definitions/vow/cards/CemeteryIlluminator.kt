/**
 * Cemetery Illuminator
 * {1}{U}{U}
 * Creature — Spirit
 * 2/3
 * Flying
 * Whenever this creature enters or attacks, exile a card from a graveyard.
 * You may look at the top card of your library any time.
 * Once each turn, you may cast a spell from the top of your library if it shares a card type with a
 * card exiled with this creature.
 *
 * The blue half of the Crimson Vow cemetery cycle, and the last of the five. Like [CemeteryProwler]
 * it keeps exiling — one card per enter *and* per attack — so its payoff reads the whole
 * linked-exile pile (CR 607) rather than a single "the exiled card": `sharingCardTypeWithLinkedExile`
 * is the filter form of the reading `CostReductionSource.SharedCardTypesWithLinkedExile` already
 * takes on the Prowler's cost side. An index-keyed `EntityReference.LinkedExiledCard` would only
 * ever see the first exile and go stale the moment it left exile.
 *
 * "Enters or attacks" is two triggered abilities for [CemeteryGatekeeper]'s reason: the corpus
 * contracts the pair in *print* and writes it as two abilities in the model, which is the spelling
 * Argentum Assay reads and prints.
 *
 * The last line splits cleanly onto two existing statics: [LookAtTopOfLibrary] for "you may look at
 * the top card of your library any time", and [CastSpellTypesFromTopOfLibrary] with
 * `maxCastsPerTurn = 1` for "once each turn, you may cast a spell from the top of your library if …".
 * The allowance belongs to the *permanent*, so an Illuminator that leaves and returns brings a fresh
 * one — which is what the second static's own contract says, and what a second Illuminator relies on.
 *
 * Per its 2021-11-19 ruling the comparison is against the **exiled** cards, not against the top
 * card's other faces: a modal double-faced card whose back face shares a type may be cast even when
 * its front face doesn't, because the shared type comes off the exile pile either way.
