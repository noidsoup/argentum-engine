/**
 * Fight Rigging
 * {2}{G}
 * Enchantment
 *
 * Hideaway 5 (When this enchantment enters, look at the top five cards of your library, exile
 * one face down, then put the rest on the bottom in a random order.)
 * At the beginning of combat on your turn, put a +1/+1 counter on target creature you control.
 * Then if you control a creature with power 7 or greater, you may play the exiled card without
 * paying its mana cost.
 *
 * Hideaway is modeled compositionally, same shape as Mosswort Bridge / Evercoat Ursine: the ETB
 * trigger gathers the top five cards, prompts the controller to exile one face down (linked to
 * this enchantment), and bottom-randomizes the rest. The beginning-of-combat trigger targets a
 * creature you control for the mandatory +1/+1 counter, then gates the immediate free cast behind
 * [ConditionalEffect] testing [Conditions.YouControlAtLeast] on a power-7-or-greater creature —
 * only the "may play" half is conditional; the counter always happens if there's a legal target.
