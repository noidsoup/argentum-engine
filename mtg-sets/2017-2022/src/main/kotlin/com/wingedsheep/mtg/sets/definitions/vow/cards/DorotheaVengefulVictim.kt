/**
 * Dorothea, Vengeful Victim // Dorothea's Retribution (Innistrad: Crimson Vow #235 — the card's
 * earliest printing)
 * {W}{U} · Legendary Creature — Spirit 4/4 // Enchantment — Aura
 *
 * Front — Dorothea, Vengeful Victim ({W}{U}, Legendary Creature — Spirit, 4/4)
 *   Flying
 *   When Dorothea attacks or blocks, sacrifice it at end of combat.
 *   Disturb {1}{W}{U}
 *
 * Back — Dorothea's Retribution (Enchantment — Aura, white/blue color indicator)
 *   Enchant creature
 *   Enchanted creature has "Whenever this creature attacks, create a 4/4 white Spirit creature
 *   token with flying that's tapped and attacking. Sacrifice that token at end of combat."
 *   If Dorothea's Retribution would be put into a graveyard from anywhere, exile it instead.
 *
 * "Attacks or blocks" is **two** triggered abilities rather than one `EventPattern.AnyOf`. A creature
 * can never do both in one combat, so the pair fires at most once either way, and this is the
 * spelling the corpus writes 60 times against three — and the one Argentum Assay prints, so the card
 * and the grammar agree instead of the card landing in the gate's divergence list.
 *
 * The sacrifice is a delayed trigger set up on resolution ([CreateDelayedTriggerEffect] at
 * [Step.END_COMBAT], CR 603.7b), not an immediate one: Dorothea deals her combat damage first, and if
 * she leaves the battlefield before end of combat the delayed trigger simply finds nothing to
 * sacrifice. [SacrificeSelfEffect] is the verb with no object — it reads the delayed trigger's own
 * source — and is the majority of the SDK's two spellings of "sacrifice it".
 *
 * The back face quotes the *other* half of the card's design onto the enchanted creature, which is
 * [GrantTriggeredAbility] — the same shape [MischievousCatgeist]'s Aura face uses. Inside the
 * quotes, "this creature" is the creature that has the ability (the enchanted one), which is what
 * `Triggers.Attacks`'s SELF binding already means for a granted ability. The token half is Geist of
 * Saint Traft's exactly: [CreateTokenEffect] with `tapped`/`attacking` (CR 508.1 — put onto the
 * battlefield attacking, never "declared", so it triggers nothing that watches attack declaration)
 * followed by a delayed trigger over `CREATED_TOKENS`, which is how "that token" names the object
 * the same resolution just made. Geist exiles its token; this one sacrifices it, so the token's
 * controller loses it even if it has changed hands.
 *
 * Disturb is CR 702.146; the exile-instead clause is [RedirectZoneChange] with `selfOnly = true` so
 * it functions from every zone (CR 614.12).
