/**
 * Angrath's Ambusher
 * {2}{B}
 * Creature — Orc Pirate
 * 2/3
 * This creature gets +2/+0 as long as you control an Angrath planeswalker.
 *
 * The condition is [Exists] over a battlefield planeswalker with the Angrath subtype —
 * [Player.You] carries the "you control" half, so the filter itself has no controller predicate.
 * `ModifyStats.filter` defaults to the attached creature, so [Filters.Self] is passed explicitly.
