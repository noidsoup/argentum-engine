 * One of the "slow lands" — enters untapped only once you already control at least
 * two other lands. The [GameObjectFilter.Land] aggregate counts the entering land
 * itself, so "two or more *other* lands" is "three or more lands total", i.e. the
 * untapped condition is `controlled lands >= 3`.
