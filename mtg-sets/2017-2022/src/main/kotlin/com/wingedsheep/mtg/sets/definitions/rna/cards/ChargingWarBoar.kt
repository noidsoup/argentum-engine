/**
 * Charging War Boar — Ravnica Allegiance #271
 * {1}{R}{G} · Creature — Boar · 3 / 1
 *
 * "A Domri planeswalker" is the planeswalker filter narrowed by the planeswalker *subtype*
 * (CR 205.3j); [Conditions.YouControl] is the battlefield-existence check. The pump and the
 * trample grant are **two** conditional statics sharing one condition rather than one
 * [ConditionalStaticAbility] over a composite — they live in different layers (7c and 6), so
 * keeping them apart is what lets the layer system order them independently.
