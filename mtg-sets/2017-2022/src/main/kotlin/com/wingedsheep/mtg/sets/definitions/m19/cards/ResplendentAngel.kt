/**
 * Resplendent Angel
 * {1}{W}{W}
 * Creature — Angel
 * 3/3
 *
 * Flying
 * At the beginning of each end step, if you gained 5 or more life this turn, create a 4/4 white
 * Angel creature token with flying and vigilance.
 * {3}{W}{W}{W}: Until end of turn, this creature gets +2/+2 and gains lifelink.
 *
 * The token trigger is an intervening-"if" ability: it only triggers if you gained 5 or more life
 * total during the turn before the end step begins (net change / other life loss is irrelevant;
 * life gained during the end step itself is too late), and it re-checks on resolution.
