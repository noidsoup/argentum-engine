/**
 * Mazemind Tome
 * {2}
 * Artifact — Book
 *
 * {T}, Put a page counter on this artifact: Scry 1.
 * {2}, {T}, Put a page counter on this artifact: Draw a card.
 * When there are four or more page counters on this artifact, exile it. If you do, you gain 4 life.
 *
 * The counter is an *accruing activation cost* ([Costs.PutCounterOnSelf]), not a resolution
 * effect — it is paid whether or not the ability resolves, and it is always payable, which is
 * what lets the fourth activation happen at all before the state trigger exiles the Tome.
 *
 * The third ability is state-triggered (CR 603.8): there is no event to hang it on, the engine
 * polls the counter count and fires on the false → true transition. The exile is scoped
 * `fromZone = BATTLEFIELD` so a Tome that has already left while the trigger sits on the stack
 * isn't dragged out of its new zone — and because `IfYouDoEffect`'s `Auto` criterion measures the
 * exile zone's growth, a skipped exile also means no life (Scryfall ruling below).
