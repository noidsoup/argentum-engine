/**
 * Ghoulish Procession
 * {1}{B}
 * Enchantment
 * Whenever one or more nontoken creatures die, create a 2/2 black Zombie creature token with
 * decayed. This ability triggers only once each turn.
 *
 * The batched death trigger ([Triggers.OneOrMoreCreaturesDie] over nontoken creatures) fires at
 * most once per death batch (CR 603.3b) and is further capped to once per turn (`oncePerTurn`).
 * The token gets Decayed via a decayed counter ([Counters.DECAYED]) — the engine realizes "can't
 * block" + "when it attacks, sacrifice it at end of combat" off the counter (CR 702.147a).
 *
 * That counter is why Assay's differential reports this card: the printed "with decayed" is a
 * keyword on the token, so the grammar reads `CreateTokenEffect.keywords`, and the engine does not
 * realize Decayed from there. Deliberately left as it is — this spelling is the one that works, and
 * closing the gap is engine work rather than a card edit. See `Tokens.createToken`'s KDoc in
 * `:oracle-assay`.
