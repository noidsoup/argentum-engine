/**
 * Rain of Riches {3}{R}{R}
 * Enchantment
 *
 * When this enchantment enters, create two Treasure tokens.
 * The first spell you cast each turn that mana from a Treasure was spent to cast has
 * cascade.
 *
 * "Has cascade" is modeled as a triggered ability on Rain of Riches (same shape as
 * Wildsear, Scouring Maw): whenever the controller casts a spell paid for with treasure
 * mana, and it's the first such spell this turn, fire [com.wingedsheep.sdk.dsl.Effects.Cascade]
 * pointing at the triggering spell. Cascade itself is a triggered ability (CR 702.85a),
 * so the resulting game behavior matches "the spell has cascade" without needing to grant
 * the keyword to the spell on the stack.
