/**
 * Kargan Dragonrider
 * {1}{R}
 * Creature — Human Warrior
 * 2/2
 * As long as you control a Dragon, this creature has flying.
 *
 * Canonical earliest real printing: Core Set 2019 (M19). Reprinted in Foundations (FDN).
 *
 * Modeled as a conditional static ability: GrantKeyword(FLYING, Self) gated by
 * YouControl(a Dragon). The continuous keyword grant is re-evaluated by the layer system
 * whenever the controlled-Dragon condition changes, matching "as long as".
 *
 * The condition counts Dragon *permanents*, not Dragon creatures: a bare tribal noun names the
 * subtype and not the card type, so an animated Dragon land or a noncreature Dragon permanent
 * satisfies "you control a Dragon" too. Found by the Assay differential.
