/**
 * Brineborn Cutthroat
 * {1}{U}
 * Creature — Merfolk Pirate
 * 2/1
 *
 * Flash
 * Whenever you cast a spell during an opponent's turn, put a +1/+1 counter on this creature.
 *
 * The grow trigger uses [Triggers.YouCastSpell] gated by [Conditions.IsNotYourTurn] as a
 * fire-time trigger condition, so it only fires for spells cast on a turn that isn't the
 * controller's — the "during an opponent's turn" rider. Flash lets it be cast at instant
 * speed to enable those responses in the first place.
 *
 * Canonical printing: Core Set 2020 (earliest real printing). Reprinted in Jumpstart 2022
 * (J22 #278) and Foundations (FDN #152).
