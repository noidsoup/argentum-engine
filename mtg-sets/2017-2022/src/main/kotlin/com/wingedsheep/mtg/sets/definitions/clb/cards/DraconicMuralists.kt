/**
 * Draconic Muralists
 * {3}{G}
 * Creature — Dragon Bard
 * 4/3
 * When this creature dies, you may search your library for a Dragon card, reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle.
 *
 * A dies trigger over the stock tutor recipe: [Patterns.Library.searchLibrary] is the whole
 * gather / select / reveal-and-move / shuffle pipeline, so only the destination and the reveal are
 * spelled here. "A Dragon card" is a bare tribal noun — any permanent card with the subtype, not
 * only a creature — and the printed "you may" is the ability's `optional` flag, which the builder
 * lowers into the consent gate around the search.
